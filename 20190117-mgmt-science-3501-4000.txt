Assume the trader is long the market (owns the security). A trailing stop is an order to sell the security at the market, if the price of the security drops to the stop price. The stop price is always less than the market price when the stop is entered. As the price fluctuates, the stop is raised to remain a fixed distance from the maximum price at which the security trades. In this paper we consider two models for the price process: a discrete time random walk and continuous time Brownian motion, both with positive drift. For these price processes we compute the distribution, mean, and variance of the gain to the trader as well as the duration of the trade when a trailing stop strategy is used. Also discussed is the question of optimizing the distance from the current price to the stop.		GLYNN, PW (reprint author), STANFORD UNIV,TERMAN ENGN CTR,DEPT OPERAT RES,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.

However, when the arrival process is a nonstationary Poisson process, the insensitivity property is lost. We develop a simple, effective numerical algorithm for the M(t)/PH/s/0 model with two service phases and a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process, and apply it to show that the time-dependent blocking probability with nonstationary input can be strongly influenced by the service-time distribution beyond the mean. With sinusoidal arrival rates, the peak blocking probability typically increases as the service-time distribution gets less variable. The influence of the service-time distribution, including this seemingly anomalous behavior, can be understood and predicted from the modified-offered-load and stationary-peakedness approximations, which exploit exact results for related infinite-server models.

We develop a dynamic optimization model which considers the actions of the manufacturer, retailers, and consumers. The manufacturer attempts to maximize its profits by advertising directly to consumers and offering periodic trade deal discounts to the retailer in the hope that the retailer will in turn ''pass through'' a retailer promotion to the consumer. We show how the manufacturer's optimal allocation depends on consumer response to advertising, consumer response to retailer promotions, retailer inventory carrying cost, and retailer passthrough behavior. For example, we find that retailer carrying costs and promotion wearout play a central role in constraining expenditures on trade promotions. We predict that as trade promotions are designed to eliminate forward buying, manufacturers will find it in their interest to promote more steeply. We also find a natural tendency for advertising and trade dealing to substitute for each other in an optimal plan.

In this case, if most attribute level combinations define feasible products, constructing product lines directly from part-worths data is necessary. For three typical formulations of this important problem, Kohli and Sukumar (1990) present state-of-the-art heuristics to find good solutions. In this paper, we develop improved heuristics based on a beam search approach for solving these problems. In our computations for 435 simulated problems, significant improvements occur in five important performance measures used. Our heuristic solutions are closer to the optimal, have smaller standard deviation over replicates, take less computation time, obtain optimal solutions more often and identify a number of ''good'' product lines explicitly. Computation times for these problems are no more than 22 seconds on a PC, small enough for adequate sensitivity analysis. We also apply the heuristics to a real data set and clarify computational steps by giving a detailed example.

Comparative-static effects of changes in the various price and cost parameters are determined and related to the newsboy's risk aversion. The addition of a random background wealth and of an increase in the riskiness of newspaper demand are also examined. Although many of the comparative effects generally are ambiguous, some fairly simple restrictions on preferences and/or risk increases are shown to lead to qualitatively deterministic results.

In this paper, we compare and contrast three different approaches: risk-adjusted discount-rate analysis, option pricing analysis, and decision analysis, focusing on the last two. We show that, in contrast to some of the claims made in the ''real options'' literature, when both option pricing and decision analysis methods are correctly applied, they must give consistent results. We also explore ways in which option pricing and decision analysis methods can be profitably integrated. In particular, we show how option pricing techniques can be used to simplify decision analyses when some risks can be hedged by trading and, conversely, how decision analysis techniques can be used to extend option pricing techniques to problems with incomplete securities markets.

We describe an experiment in which subjects solve a variant of the classic armed-bandit problem of dynamic decision theory, set in the context of airline choice. Subjects are asked to make repeated choices between two hypothetical airlines, one having an on-time departure probability which is known a priori, and the other has an ambiguous probability whose true value can only be discovered by making sample trips on the airline. Subjects attempt to make choices in such a way as to maximize the total number of one-time departures over a fixed planning horizon. We examine the extent to which actual choice patterns over time are consistent with those which would be made by a decision maker acting as an optimal Bernoulli sampler. The data offer support for a number of expected-and some unexpected-departures from optimality, including a tendency to underexperiment with promising options and overexperiment with unpromising options, and a tendency to increasingly switch between airlines as the average base rate of departures decreases. Implications of the work for the descriptive validity of normative dynamic decision models is explored, as well as for the generalizability of previous findings about choice under ambiguity to dynamic settings.

Since a rule base can be regarded as an acyclic AND/OR digraph, the unified model is virtually a multiobjective decision making problem that considers both numeric and symbolic objectives and decision variables. To solve this problem, the Post-model Analysis approach is adopted. An essential feature of the Post-model Analysis is that it supports nondominated tradeoffs among the numeric and symbolic objectives. So, this paper proposes a set of methods for computing the nondominated solutions. A prototype UNIK-PMA that realizes the idea is developed as a subsystem of the UNIK (UNIfied Knowledge) system.

Results indicate that project supervisors significantly affect the chances of one's promotion along each track. Professionals reporting to supervisors promoted to the technical ladder were significantly more likely to also be promoted technically, especially in research. On the other hand, professionals reporting to gatekeeping supervisors in development were significantly more likely to be promoted up the managerial ladder. Gatekeeper status was more important in influencing subordinates' communication activities and subsequent promotions than supervisors' promotion path. These results underscore the importance of managing socialization and the career paths of gatekeepers and those reporting to them for enhancing the success of dual ladder reward systems.

J	CHENG, DW				CHENG, DW			LINE REVERSIBILITY OF TANDEM QUEUES WITH GENERAL BLOCKING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TANDEM QUEUE; BLOCKING; REVERSIBILITY; SYMMETRY; BUFFER ALLOCATION; ORDER OF SERVERS	QUEUING-SYSTEMS; DUALITY; KANBAN	We extend the ''line reversibility'' property to a serial production system controlled using the ''general blocking'' scheme. The control mechanism is characterized by three vectors of integer parameters (a, b, k) which are, respectively, control parameters for the number of raw jobs, finished jobs, and buffer positions at each stage. We establish conditions under which the time to process a given set of jobs in a system does not change when the control parameters are in the reversed order. For cases where reversibility does not hold, we introduce a more restrictive form of reversibility-referred to as ''semi-reversibility''-and establish conditions under which the property holds. Our results imply reversibility of the kanban system and provide an alternative proof for previous results established for the communication and the manufacturing blockings. Our approach is simple and readily extends to closed systems where the number of jobs in the system is kept constant. Finally, we show, via an example, that in general reversibility does not prevail for this blocking mechanism.

This holds in particular for planning problems over time, where an optimal decision in a given period depends on information related to a limited future time horizon, a so-called forecast horizon, only. In this paper we identify a general class of dynamic programs in which an efficient forward algorithm can be designed to solve the problem and to identify minimal forecast horizons. Such a procedure specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for a stage to arise as a forecast horizon. This class of dynamic programs includes the single-item dynamic lot-sizing model with general concave costs, both with and without backlogging, to which special attention is given.

Both switch-over time and cost are incurred when the facility switches from performing one type of operation to a different type, Upon the completion of a batch of jobs in the regular mode, each batch is subjected to a test, where the entire batch (of jobs) will be classified accordingly as either nondefective, repairable, or nonrepairable. A nondefective batch continues its process downstream, a nonrepairable batch is scrapped, and a repairable batch can be cycled back to the bottleneck facility for repair. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal repair policy for the bottleneck facility so that the long run average operating profit is maximized. We first characterize the optimal repair policy by showing that the optimal repair policy must take one of the two forms: a ''repair-none'' policy under which all repairable batches are scrapped, or a ''repair-all'' policy under which all repairable batches are repaired. We then develop optimality conditions for the repair-none policy and the repair-all policy. When the repair-all policy is optimal, we further show that there exists an optimal ''threshold'' operating policy that can be described as follows: upon completion of a regular batch, switch over to the repair mode only if the number of available repairable batches exceeds a certain threshold value. We also evaluate the impact of batch sizes, yield, and switch-over cost on the optimal operating policy.

These demand interdependencies are referred to in the literature as positive demand externalities or network externalities. This paper examines the dynamic pricing behaviors of an incumbent and a later entrant, with special attention to the impacts of demand externalities, compatibility, and competition on prices and profits. Defining market power as the ability to price above a competitor without losing market share, we show how demand externalities and installed base combine to confer market power. We model optimal pricing as a differential game with the optimal price trajectory established as Nash open-loop controls. For a duopoly durable goods market with strong demand externalities, the results show an increasing price trajectory can be optimal. As expected, a new entrant is better off if its products are compatible with those of the incumbent, especially when demand externalities are strong and the installed base of the incumbent is large. Less intuitively, the incumbent as well may be better off agreeing on common standards. The comparison of monopoly and duopoly shows that under strong demand externalities and a small installed base, the incumbent profits from compatible entry.

The paper uses system-point level-crossing theory to derive expressions for the distribution and expected value of on-hand inventory, ordering rate, and the expected total cost rate for a given ordering policy. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, and a number of qualitative properties are provided to illustrate the use of the results to obtain optimal order quantities.

J	SESHADRI, S				SESHADRI, S			BIDDING FOR CONTESTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						AGENCY THEORY; BIDDING; CONTESTS; DUAL SOURCING; PROCUREMENT	INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; PROCUREMENT; COMPETITION; INNOVATION; PRIZES	The procurement of product development and production services brings special strategic considerations to the buyer-seller relationship in industrial and institutional markets. Multiple sourcing, in particular dual sourcing, is a likely way of dealing with the increased risks faced by buyers. However, there is lack of dual sourcing models that analyze the selection and control process in an integrated fashion. This omission has led to apparently contradictory findings in agency and auction theory. The paper models the strategic issues for a cost containment contest between two suppliers. The suppliers are drawn from several vendors who participate in a bidding competition. The supplier with the lower final cost in the contest wins a larger share of the pooled profit fee. Propositions are derived for the optimal cost-plus contest, and comparisons are made with the common incentive contract for the integrated selection and control model. The larger the winner's share, the greater the effort. The buyer can make a credible commitment to the optimal winner's share. As the winner's share rises, however, the bid prices increase due to increased contract risk. This incentive-risk tradeoff determines (a) the optimal winner's share that minimizes expected procurement price, (b) the corresponding profit fee bid by suppliers, (c) the ensuing cost control effort, and (d) the final price for the procurement. Comparisons with the common incentive contract tell us when the cost-plus contest induces more effort, and when bidding for a contest results in a lower final procurement price.

J	JORDAN, WC; GRAVES, SC				JORDAN, WC; GRAVES, SC			PRINCIPLES ON THE BENEFITS OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS FLEXIBILITY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; CAPACITY PLANNING; PRODUCT ALLOCATION		Increasing manufacturing flexibility is a key strategy for efficiently improving market responsiveness in the face of uncertain future product demand. Process flexibility results from being able to build different types of products in the same plant or production facility at the same time. In Part I of this paper, we develop several principles on the benefits of process flexibility. These principles are that 1) limited flexibility (i.e., each plant builds only a few products), configured in the right way, yields most of the benefits of total flexibility (i.e., each plant builds all products) and 2) limited flexibility has the greatest benefits when configured to chain products and plants together to the greatest extent possible. In Part II, we provide analytic support and justification for these principles. Based on a planning model for assigning production to plants, we demonstrate that, for realistic assumptions on demand uncertainty, limited flexibility configurations (i.e., how products are assigned to plants) have sales benefits that are approximately equivalent to those for total flexibility. Furthermore, from this analysis we develop a simple measure for the flexibility in a given product-plant configuration. Such a measure is desirable because of the complexity of computing expected sales for a given configuration. The measure is II(M*), the maximal probability over all groupings or sets of products (M) that there will be unfilled demand for a set of products while simultaneously there is excess capacity at plants building other products. This measure is easily computed and can be used to guide the search for good limited flexibility configurations.

J	THOMPSON, GM				THOMPSON, GM			IMPROVED IMPLICIT OPTIMAL MODELING OF THE LABOR SHIFT SCHEDULING PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						LABOR SCHEDULING; INTEGER PROGRAMMING; IMPLICIT MODELING	OPERATOR	This paper presents an integer programming model for developing optimal shift schedules while allowing extensive flexibility in terms of alternate shift starting times, shift lengths, and break placement. The model combines the work of Moondra (1976) and Bechtold and Jacobs (1990) by implicitly matching meal breaks to implicitly represented shifts. Moreover, the new model extends the work of these authors to enable the scheduling of overtime and the scheduling of rest breaks. We compare the new model to Bechtold and Jacobs' model over a diverse set of 588 test problems. The new model generates optimal solutions more rapidly, solves problems with more shift alternatives, and does not generate schedules violating the operative restrictions on break timing.

J	DUENYAS, I				DUENYAS, I			SINGLE FACILITY DUE-DATE SETTING WITH MULTIPLE CUSTOMER CLASSES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DELIVERY TIME COMPETITION; TIME-SENSITIVE CUSTOMERS; PRICING; SEQUENCING	JOB-SHOP; DUE-DATES	We consider the interrelated problems of (1) quoting a due date to each customer arriving to a production system modeled as a single-server queue and (2) sequencing customer orders once they are in the system. We allow several different classes of customers, each with different preferences for lead time and price. We first formulate the problem of quoting due dates under the assumption that customer orders are processed on a FCFS basis. Next, we consider the case where the firm has the option to schedule orders in other than FCFS order. For this case, we develop a heuristic for quoting due dates and sequencing orders. Simulation results suggest that policies that take into account customer price and due date preferences in scheduling and quoting due dates significantly outperform due date setting policies that do not.

J	SO, KC; TANG, CS				SO, KC; TANG, CS			OPTIMAL OPERATING POLICY FOR A BOTTLENECK WITH RANDOM REWORK	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						BOTTLENECK WITH REWORK; OPTIMAL OPERATING POLICY; THRESHOLD POLICY; SEMI-MARKOV DECISION PROCESS	PARALLEL MACHINES; EOQ MODEL; LOT; SYSTEMS; SERVER; SETUPS; TIMES	This paper presents a model of a bottleneck facility that performs two distinct types of operations: ''regular'' and ''rework.'' Each job is subjected to a test after completing the regular operation at the bottleneck. If the job passes the test, then it continues its process downstream. Otherwise, the job will cycle back to the bottleneck stage for rework operation. Upon the completion of a batch of regular jobs, Me decision maker observes the amount of rework and decides on whether to switch over to process the reworks or continue to process another batch of regular jobs. It is assumed that both switch-over time and cost are incurred when the facility switches from performing one type of operation to a different type. The goal of the analysis is to characterize Me optimal operating policy for the bottleneck so that the average operating cost is minimized. In order to characterize the optimal operating policy, we first formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process. Then we show that there exists an optimal ''threshold'' operating policy that can be described as follows: upon completion of a batch of regular jobs, switch over to process the reworks only if the number of reworks exceeds a critical value. In addition, we develop a simple procedure to compute the critical value that specifies the optimal threshold policy. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of batch sizes, yield, and switch-over time on the optimal threshold policy.

J	RADHAKRISHNAN, S; BALACHANDRAN, KR				RADHAKRISHNAN, S; BALACHANDRAN, KR			DELAY COST AND INCENTIVE SCHEMES FOR MULTIPLE USERS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DELAY COST; AGENCY COST; COMMON FACILITY; STOCHASTIC CHOICE HAZARD; MORAL HAZARD; INCENTIVE SCHEME; EQUILIBRIUM		This paper examines the role of cost application in the presence of delay and agency costs. Two risk neutral division managers share a common (production) facility and decide on (a) the demand (usage) rates, and (b) productive action, Each division manager causes costly delays at the common production facility for the other division manager. The expected delay depends on the demand rates chosen by the division managers. An M/G/1 queuing framework is used to characterize delay costs. The unobservability of demand rates leads to stochastic choice hazard, and the unobservability of productive actions leads to moral hazard problems. The headquarters designs incentive schemes such that the use of the common facility is optimal for the firm. We show that a franchise contract is necessary to implement the first-best solution (similar to Harris and Raviv 1979), but is not sufficient. Specifically, when the action aversion of one division manager is small, the use of a franchise contract leads to ''greedy'' behavior by that division manager. The cost application required is greater than the expected marginal cost of delay to preclude the greedy behavior and ensure a stable equilibrium.

J	ALLEN, S; RAMANAN, R				ALLEN, S; RAMANAN, R			INSIDER TRADING, EARNINGS CHANGES, AND STOCK-PRICES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						REPORTABLE INSIDER TRADING; ADDITIVE EFFECT; INTERACTIVE EFFECT; EARNINGS RESPONSE COEFFICIENT	INFORMATION	This study empirically examines the relation between reportable insider trading and the information captured by annual unexpected earnings for a large sample of firms, spanning a ten-year period (1978-87). Each observation is assigned to one of four groups based on the direction of net insider trading(Buy, Sell) and the sign (+,-) of unexpected earnings. For each of these groups, 15-month cumulative abnormal returns are regressed on annual unexpected earnings. The slope coefficient is the largest for the group where insiders are net purchasers and the sign of unexpected earnings is positive. This is consistent with an inference that insider buying interactively confirms the favorable information captured by positive unexpected earnings and this interaction reduces the noise in unexpected earnings. The result with regard to the unfavorable information captured by the group with insider selling and negative unexpected earnings is similar but less pronounced. The analysis also suggests that insider trading conveys information not fully captured by that year's earnings.

This setting generalizes the usual approach to single-facility resource allocation by allowing for the effective capacity of a facility to be a (nonlinear) function of the number of different items produced or the services delivered by the facility. Economies or diseconomies of scope are attributable to factors such as production changeover time, overall process management requirements, and complementary production requirements that vary with the product or service mix. We consider the problem setting in which the effective capacity depends on the number of tasks assigned to the facility. The resulting model(SCOPE) generalizes the well-known 0-1 knapsack problem. We also consider the more general problem(GENCAP) in which capacity consumption depends on the specific set of tasks assigned to the facility. We define tabu-search heuristics, as well as exact branch-and-bound algorithms for SCOPE and GENCAP. On the basis of extensive computational experience, the solution procedures are seen to be extremely effective. In particular, the heuristics consistently obtain high-quality solutions to the test problems. Furthermore, the tractability of solving problems to optimality is demonstrated through the solution of SCOPE problems having as many as 500 tasks and GENCAP problems involving as many as 50 tasks and more than 16,500 nonlinear capacity interactions.

We compare two alternative policies, representing different modes of collecting and utilizing information. We derive a closed-form measure of performance for one of them, the familiar first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy, and propose a comparable approximation for the other, the longest-queue (LQ) policy. These results are illustrated and tested through simulations. In this way we address several basic managerial issues: What is the value of centralized information in complex systems? How does the breadth of the product line affect performance?		ZIPKIN, PH (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV,GRAD SCH BUSINESS,NEW YORK,NY 10027, USA.						Arrow K. J, 1958, STUDIES MATH THEORY; Cohen J.

First, we show that any quadratic function can be expressed as a sum of particular quadratic functions whose minima can be computed by a simple branch and bound algorithm. Then, assuming some hypothesis, we prove that, among all possible decompositions, the best one can be found by a Lagrangian decomposition method. Moreover, we show that our algorithm gives at least the roof dual bound and should give better results in practice. Eventually, computational results and comparisons with Pardalos and Rodgers' algorithm demonstrate the efficiency of our method for medium size problems (up to 100 variables).

Our lower bound is based on a linearization of the problem and its modification obtained by incorporating the knowledge of a known heuristic solution. A lower bound was computed for some standard data sets from the literature ranging between 10 and 25 nodes, with 2, 3, and 4 hubs, and for different values for the parameter alpha, representing the discount far the flow between hubs. The novel approach of using a known heuristic solution to derive a lower bound in all cases reduced the difference between the upper and lower bound. This difference measures the quality of the best known heuristic solution in percentages above the best lower bound. As a result of this research, for smaller problems (all instances with 10 and 15 nodes) the average difference is reduced to 3.3%. For larger sets (20 and 25 nodes) the average difference is reduced to 5.9%.

Derivative payoffs can still be replicated, except that this occurs at the stopping time at which the ''realized cumulative squared volatility'' hits a predetermined level. The application of these results to portfolio insurance is emphasized, and hedging strategies studied by Black and Jones and by Brennan and Schwartz are generalized. Classical results on European-style options arise as special cases. For example, the initial cost of replicating a call or a put under the new method is given by a generalized Black-Scholes formula, which yields the ordinary Black-Scholes formula when the volatility is deterministic.

It is common knowledge that the good has zero value to the seller. Its value to the buyer is privately known, distributed independently of the seller's value according to a distribution that is common knowledge. Bargaining proceeds as follows. The seller sets a price and offers the buyer an opportunity to purchase the good. The buyer either waits for at least one more period or agrees to purchase the good at the given price. If the buyer refuses the offer, then the process is repeated with the seller making a new offer on the next period. Our findings reveal several behavioral regularities, which do not support the sequential equilibrium for this bargaining mechanism. In line with recent developments in behavioral decision theory and game theory, which assume bounded rationality, we find that subjects follow simple rules of thumb in choosing strategies, reflected in the behavioral consistencies observed in this study.

This paper investigates the effect of warranty execution on the expected warranty reserves of a linear pro rata rebate plan. The failure distribution investigated includes the Weibull distribution with different parameter values. A weight function is used that depicts the effect of warranty execution. Several forms of this warranty execution function modeling consumer behavior, which is influenced by factors such as the rebate plan, warranty time, product class, and warranty attrition, are studied. Expected present value of warranty reserves, by using a factor that includes the firm's discount rate and the general inflation rate, are found for the different warranty execution functions. The impact of the warranty execution function on the warranty reserves per unit is explored. The paper also investigates the effects of the model parameters, such as the failure distribution parameters and differences in consumer behavior in claiming warranties on warranty costs per unit.

J	WANG, ETG; SEIDMANN, A				WANG, ETG; SEIDMANN, A			ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE - COMPETITIVE EXTERNALITIES AND STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE; COMPETITIVE EXTERNALITIES; EDI ADOPTION; IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES OF INTERORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS	MARKETS	Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is an emerging type of standardized inter-organizational information system. We analyze the impact of EDI on the upstream suppliers' competitive position in a simple two-level hierarchical market structure where the buyer faces a linear demand curve and the competing heterogeneous suppliers have an upward-sloping marginal cost function. We show that a supplier's adoption of EDI can generate positive externalities for the buyer and negative (or competitive) externalities for other suppliers. As a result, the buyer provides a price premium to those suppliers who adopt EDI and increases their sales volume and market share. Moreover, when the benefits that the buyer can derive from implementing EDI are substantial, and the suppliers' EDI adoption costs are high, it may be in the buyer's best interest to subsidize the suppliers so as to encourage them to adopt EDI, instead of mandating them to do so. Regardless of whether the buyer employs a mandatory or a subsidizing policy, the buyer and the end consumers may be the only ones who gain from this new technology. Consequently, a partial adoption by the supplier base may be optimal for the buyer when the suppliers' adoption costs are sufficiently high. We also show that, while EDI reduces the transaction costs of the buyer, the upstream market tends to become more concentrated as a result of increased cost differentials. These results provide one economic explanation of the fact that many companies have actually reduced their supplier base after implementing EDI, despite a significant reduction in their market transaction costs.

J	SRINIVASAN, A; TEENI, D				SRINIVASAN, A; TEENI, D			MODELING AS CONSTRAINED PROBLEM-SOLVING - AN EMPIRICAL-STUDY OF THE DATA MODELING PROCESS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference of Information Systems	DEC, 1990	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK			PROBLEM SOLVING; DATA MODELING; COGNITIVE PROCESSES; PROCESS TRACING; HEURISTICS; LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION	KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	Modeling is a powerful tool for managing complexity in problem solving. Problem solvers usually build a simplified model of the real world and then use it to generate a solution to their problem. To date, however, little is known about how people actually behave when building a model. This study concentrates on data modeling, which involves the representation of different types of data and their interrelationships. It reports on two laboratory studies, in which subjects engage in data modeling to solve a complex problem. Using a think-aloud process-tracing methodology, we examine the data modeling behavior as a set of activities that are managed by several heuristics. We found that some heuristics were effective in reducing the complexity of the problem. An important aspect we observed was how subjects moved across levels of abstraction in the problem representation. Overall, these observations help to explain how people deal with complexity in data modeling. They also suggest that it may be advantageous to design systems that support work at various levels of abstraction and support transitions among those levels.

The game's solution contains specialized information which may be used to conduct the efficiency evaluation currently done by the CCR ratio model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Consequently, a rigorous connection between DEA's CCR model and the theory of games is established. Interpretations of these new solutions are discussed in the context of current ongoing applications.

The model uses a piecewise linear envelopment of confidence regions for observed stochastic multiple-input multiple-output combinations in the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tradition. The model allows for an exogenous decomposition of the total variation in data for each Decision Making Unit (DMU). By varying certain probability levels the model can provide estimates of the sensitivity of efficiency scores regarding an unknown amount of noise in data. An application of the method in an evaluation of the research activities in economic departments at Danish Universities is presented.

Moreover, while most of the planning tools available to managers assume that projects are independent clusters of activities, in reality many organizations must manage concurrent projects that place competing demands on shared human and technical resources. This study develops an empirically-based framework for analyzing development time in such contexts. We model the product development organization as a stochastic processing network in which engineering resources are ''workstations'' and projects are ''jobs'' that flow between the workstations. At any given time, a job is either receiving service or queueing for access to a resource. Our model's spreadsheets quantify this division of time, and our simulation experiments investigate the determinants of development cycle time. This class of models provides a useful managerial framework for studying product development because it enables formal performance analysis, and it points to data that should be collected by organizations seeking to improve development cycle times. Such models also provide a conceptual framework for characterizing commonalities and differences between engineering and manufacturing operations.

The problem is to determine the number, size, and locations of stations given constraints on the maximum travel distance from each town to its nearest station and the average waiting time at a station. In this paper we use simulation to find the maximum allowable arrival rates (in vehicles per hour) of stations of different sizes and formulate the station location problem as a set covering model. We generate a range of solutions through sensitivity analysis, varying both the average waiting time and maximum distance constraints. Comparing the current configuration of stations in Connecticut to our integer programming solutions we find that the integer programming approach reduces the objective function by at least $3 million. The current configuration has more stations than the IP solutions but they are not-as well distributed.

J	MOINZADEH, K; KLASTORIN, TD				MOINZADEH, K; KLASTORIN, TD			MEASURING THE IMPACT OF A DELAY BUFFER ON QUALITY COSTS WITH AN UNRELIABLE PRODUCTION PROCESS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						QUALITY MANAGEMENT; SAMPLING INSPECTION POLICIES; UNRELIABLE PRODUCTION PROCESSES; DELAY BUFFER		In this paper, we consider an unreliable production process which produces nondefective items when operating in control, but produces defective items with a probability oc when the process has shifted to an out-of-control state. Following a JIT philosophy, we stop the entire line and repair the machine as soon as we detect that the process has shifted to an out-of-control state. To test whether a process shift has occurred, we inspect the last m units for every n units produced and stop the machine if a defective unit is found. More important, we place a ''delay buffer'' immediately after the unreliable process, which serves to delay the movement of items from the unreliable machine to other processes (or customers) downstream in the production system. When we detect that the machine has shifted to an out-of-control state, we stop the entire line and examine all previously uninspected items in the delay buffer; in this way, the buffer serves to reduce the expected rework and penalty (e.g., warranty) costs downstream when a process shift has occurred. In this paper, we develop a model for this approach and use this model to test the operating characteristics of our system. Computational results illustrate our hypothesis that a delay buffer may significantly reduce expected total costs of a quality control process.

J	NAKAYAMA, MK				NAKAYAMA, MK			ASYMPTOTICS OF LIKELIHOOD RATIO DERIVATIVE ESTIMATORS IN SIMULATIONS OF HIGHLY RELIABLE MARKOVIAN SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SIMULATION; GRADIENT ESTIMATION; LIKELIHOOD RATIOS; HIGHLY RELIABLE SYSTEMS; IMPORTANCE SAMPLING	PERTURBATION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; GRADIENT ESTIMATION; LIMIT-THEOREMS; MONTE-CARLO; MODELS; QUEUE; CHAINS	We discuss the estimation of derivatives of a performance measure using the likelihood ratio method in simulations of highly reliable Markovian systems. We compare the difficulties of estimating the performance measure and of estimating its partial derivatives with respect to component failure rates as the component failure rates tend to 0 and the component repair rates remain fixed. We first consider the case when the quantities are estimated using naive simulation; i.e., when no variance reduction technique is used. In particular, we prove that in the limit; some of the partial derivatives can be estimated as accurately as the performance measure itself. This result is of particular interest in light of the somewhat pessimistic empirical results others have obtained when applying the likelihood ratio method to other types of systems. However, the result only holds for certain partial derivatives of the performance measure when using naive simulation. More specifically, we can estimate a certain partial derivative with the same relative accuracy as the performance measure if the partial derivative is associated with a component either having one of the largest failure rates or whose failure can trigger a failure transition on one of the ''most likely paths to failure.'' Also, we develop a simple criterion to determine which partial derivatives will satisfy either of these properties. In particular, we can identify these derivatives using a sensitivity measure which can be calculated for each type of component. We also examine the limiting behavior of the estimates of the performance measure and its derivatives which are obtained when an importance sampling scheme known as balanced failure biasing is used. In particular, we show that the estimates of all derivatives can be improved. In contrast to the situation that arose when using naive simulation, we prove that in the limit, all derivatives can be estimated as accurately as the performance measure when balanced failure biasing is employed. Finally, we formalize the notion of a ''most likely path to failure'' in the setting of highly reliable Markovian systems. We accomplish this by proving a conditional limit theorem for the distribution of the sample paths leading to a system failure, given that a system failure occurs before the system returns to the state with all components operational. We use this result to establish our other results.		NAKAYAMA, MK (reprint author), NEW JERSEY INST TECHNOL,DEPT COMP & INFORMAT SCI,UNIV HTS,NEWARK,NJ 07102, USA.

These treatments were applied in the same way as they are in real organizational situations, with experimental conditions used to control confounding influences of other outside factors. Forty-eight groups were supported by one, both, or neither of the GSS and facilitator treatments. Groups designed a coordinated production strategy during the meeting and then implemented their strategy. Group performance, perceptions of group cohesion, and group interaction processes were assessed as the primary dependent variables. Facilitated groups experienced improved group processes and greater cohesion, whereas the GSS-supported groups did not. Facilitator and GSS support together tended to enhance one another's effective influence on cohesion and processes. No significant treatment effects on Performance were found.

J	CONNER, KR				CONNER, KR			OBTAINING STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FROM BEING IMITATED - WHEN CAN ENCOURAGING CLONES PAY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STRATEGY; CLONE; NETWORK EXTERNALITY; COPYING; TECHNOLOGY	NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; INNOVATION; COMPATIBILITY; COMPETITION; ECONOMICS; INDUSTRY	An important business strategy research theme concerns finding ways to minimize competition faced by the firm. This paper, however, focuses on a different set of situations: the model developed suggests that an innovator's best strategy may be to encourage ''clones'' of its product when a network externality is present. Key factors to consider in assessing whether encouraging cloning is the innovator's best strategy are: (1) the benefit to be derived in terms of added user base ''contributed'' by the clone sales, traded-off against (2) the unit sales that will be lost to the clone(s). These factors in turn depend upon the strength of the network effect and the degree to which the innovator's product quality is perceived by consumers to be superior to the clone's. The model further suggests that both the innovator and clone earn their highest payoffs when the clone takes the lead in price-setting, i.e., when the clone establishes its own price by considering, for each price it might set, how the innovator will react to that price, and the innovator, as price-follower, responds to the price the clone chooses. The paper demonstrates that the clone-leader/innovator-follower situation represents the unique Nash equilibrium in price-setting strategies. A central implication is that when operating in a network externality environment, instead of a problem to be avoided, clones may be valuable assets to an innovating firm, building up the user base for the innovator's technology by bringing lower-valuing consumers into the market, which in turn makes the innovator's product more attractive to high- and medium-valuing purchasers. Thus when the above-described conditions hold, being cloned can be more profitable for an innovating firm than dominating the market alone.

J	BALAKRISHNAN, PV; ELIASHBERG, J				BALAKRISHNAN, PV; ELIASHBERG, J			AN ANALYTICAL PROCESS MODEL OF 2-PARTY NEGOTIATIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						GAMES; NEGOTIATION PROCESSES; BUYER-SELLER INTERACTION	BUYER-SELLER NEGOTIATIONS; COOPERATIVE GAMES; NASH THEORY; OUTCOMES; POWER; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; CONFLICT	There has been a call to investigate the negotiation process (Gale 1986, Shubik 1982), as it is felt that this would yield important insights beyond those obtained by outcome-oriented theories (Roth 1979). This paper proposes a new analytical process model that captures both behavioral and economic aspects related to two-party negotiations. The proposed model, inspired by Pruitt's (1981) work, explicitly incorporates concepts which are both relevant and crucial, such as the negotiators' power, concession points, aspiration level, limit, and time pressure. Based on this process model, it is possible to predict (1) conditions under which agreements will not be reached despite the existence of a zone of agreement, (2) conditions under which agreements will be reached, and (3) the patterns of the negotiators' offers and counteroffers.

Two premises underlie the development of these experimental strategies. First it is assumed that the postulated metamodel may be misspecified due to the true model structure being of third-order. It is therefore important that the locations of the simulation experiments be specified to provide protection against bias, as well as variance, in the estimation of metamodel parameters. The second premise is based on the observation that, in many applications of metamodels, functions of the fitted model coefficients (such as the slope gradients) are of greater interest than the response function. The integrated mean squared error of slopes design criterion that is implemented here addresses both premises. This criterion finds application in various optimum seeking methods and sensitivity analysis procedures. Combinations of four important-classes of response surface designs and three pseudorandom number assignments strategies constitute the basic structure of the simulation designs studied. The performance of these simulation designs is evaluated and, subsequently, compared to a similar set of experimental plans that have as their focus the estimation of the response function.

Motivated by this need, we develop simulation-based methods for estimating sensitivities of inventory costs with respect to policy parameters. These sensitivity estimates are useful in adjusting optimal parameters predicted by a simplified model to complexities that can be incorporated in a simulation. We consider capacitated, multiechelon systems operating under base-stock policies and develop estimators of derivatives with respect to base-stock levels. We show that these estimates converge to the correct value for finite-horizon and infinite-horizon discounted and average cost criteria. Our methods are easy to implement and experiments suggest that they converge quickly. We illustrate their use by optimizing base-stock levels for a subsystem of the PC assembly and distribution system of a major computer manufacturer.

Thus these decisions determine the very competitiveness of the firm. Further, decisions regarding the choice of technology are very expensive to correct if incorrect decisions are identified. These decisions have become increasingly urgent and complex because the state of the art in technology is changing rapidly. However, many models available for evaluating these decisions are either too complex and inefficient or too restrictive in the number, types, and the way appearance of future technologies is modeled. This research attempts to relax some of these restrictions using forecast horizon procedures to model capital investment decisions where any number of technologies may appear in the future with purchase costs and revenues that may vary over time. The appearance of these future technologies are considered uncertain with probabilities that may also vary with time. However, we assume that the order in which they appear is sequential, much like the different generations of microchips for microcomputers. We develop a new approach using nonunique terminal rewards to solve a dynamic programming model of the problem by introducing ''converse'' difference functions and present an algorithm that is both simple and efficient. Despite the increase in state space from the use of ''converse'' functions, we show that the computational burden of the algorithm does not increase. Numerical examples are given to illustrate our algorithm. Sensitivity of the optimal decision to changes in probabilities, costs, and revenues are also discussed.

J	BEST, M; BRACKEN, J				BEST, M; BRACKEN, J			FIRST-STRIKE STABILITY IN A MULTIPOLAR WORLD	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WARFARE; STABILITY; BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE; GAME THEORY; INTERNATIONAL SECURITY	NUCLEAR	First-strike stability in a multipolar world measures the incentives of all major nuclear weapon countries, in all possible coalitions, to refrain from preemptive attack. The analysis integrates the interactions of offensive weapon arsenals, vulnerable offensive weapons within these arsenals, defensive weapons, and value targets reflecting the national assets at stake. In the previously-dominant bipolar paradigm, when the United States and the Soviet Union possessed almost all of the strategic nuclear weapons in the world, first-strike stability was an important criterion for assessing defensive deployments of the two sides, without consideration of any other countries. In the emerging multipolar world, however, the United States and Russia are dramatically reducing their offensive forces, and the offensive arsenals of Britain, France, and China are becoming relatively more important. Also, proliferation of medium-range ballistic missiles to other countries capable of attacking Russia, Britain, France, and China, but not necessarily the United States (due to range limitations), greatly complicates the overall situation. The main thrust-of this paper is to investigate the first-strike stability implications of the deployment of strategic defenses by the United States and Russia. The principal finding is that in a multipolar world first-strike stability increases with the deployment of small to medium sized strategic defenses whereas in a bipolar world it usually decreases. Although the incentives for the United States and Russia to preempt increase, the incentives of the other countries decrease, with the combined effect over all coalitions of decreasing the incentive to preempt.

A simulation based on empirically observed parameter values is used to determine which criterion is the most accurate at identifying the correct model specification. The simulation is composed of both nested and nonnested linear regression models. We then derive posterior probability estimates of the superiority of the alternative models from each of the criteria and evaluate the relative accuracy, bias, and information content of these probabilities. To investigate whether additional accuracy can be derived from combining criteria, a method for obtaining a joint prediction from combinations of the criteria is proposed and the incremental improvement in selection accuracy considered. Based on the simulation, we conclude that most leading criteria perform well in selecting the best model, and several criteria also produce accurate probabilities of model superiority. Computationally intensive criteria failed to perform better than criteria which were computationally simpler. Also, the use of several criteria in combination failed to appreciably outperform the use of one model. The Schwarz criterion performed best overall in terms of selection accuracy, accuracy of posterior probabilities, and ease of use. Thus, we suggest that general model comparison, model selection, and model probability estimation be performed using the Schwarz criterion, which can he implemented (given the model log likelihoods) using only a hand calculator.

J	MORTON, TE; PENTICO, DW				MORTON, TE; PENTICO, DW			THE FINITE-HORIZON NONSTATIONARY STOCHASTIC INVENTORY PROBLEM - NEAR-MYOPIC BOUNDS, HEURISTICS, TESTING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MYOPIC; NONSTATIONARY; INVENTORY; PLANNING HORIZONS	POLICIES; MODELS	Nonstationary stochastic periodic review inventory problems with proportional costs occur in a number of industrial settings with seasonal patterns, trends, business cycles, and limited life items. Myopic policies for such problems order as if the salvage value in the current period for ending inventory were the full purchase price, so that information about the future would not be needed. They have been shown in the Literature to be optimal when demand ''is increasing over time,'' and to provide upper bounds for the stationary finite horizon problem (and in some other situations). Some results are also known, given special salvaging assumptions, about lower bounds on the optimal policy which are near-myopic. Here analogous but stronger bounds are derived for the general finite horizon problem, without such special assumptions. The best upper bound is an extension of the heuristic used by industry for some years for end of season (EOS) problems; the lower bound is an extension of earlier analytic methods. Four heuristics were tested against the optimal obtained by stochastic dynamic programming for 969 problems. The simplest heuristic is the myopic heuristic itself: it is good especially for moderately varying problems without heavy end of season salvage costs and averages only 2.75% in cost over the optimal. However, the best of the heuristics exceeds the optimal in cost by an average of only 0.02%, at about 0.5% of the computational cost of dynamic programming.

Each retailer faces independent, normally-distributed period demand and incurs a proportional holding or backorder cost on end-of-period net-inventory. A warehouse places a system-replenishment order every m periods which is received after a fixed leadtime of T periods. Immediately upon receipt, a delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse with the system-replenishment quantity and travels to the retailers along a fixed route with fixed leadtimes between successive retailers. The warehouse holds no inventory. Under the ''static'' policy, allocations are determined for all retailers simultaneously at the moment the delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse. Under the ''dynamic'' policy, allocations are determined sequentially upon arrival of the delivery vehicle at each retailer. Our major analytical results, under appropriate dynamic (static) allocation assumptions, are: (1) optimal allocations under each policy involve bringing each retailer's ''normalized-inventory'' to a corresponding ''normalized'' system inventory; (2) optimal system replenishments are base-stock policies; (3) the minimum expected cost per cycle of dynamic (static) policy can be derived from an equivalent-dynamic (static) composite retailer. Given this, we prove that the ''risk-pooling incentive''-a simple measure of the benefit from adopting dynamic allocation policies-is always positive. Our simulation tests confirm that dynamic allocation policies yield lower costs than static policies, regardless of whether or not their respective allocation assumptions are valid.

In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures. Extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.

Yet the methodology gives no explicit role to measures of risk and return. In this paper we identify those families of utility functions that are compatible with a risk-return interpretation. From these families we deduce utility-compatible measures of risk.		BELL, DE (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV,SCH BUSINESS,BOSTON,MA 02163, USA.

J	BOHN, RE				BOHN, RE			NOISE AND LEARNING IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						YIELD; LEARNING BY EXPERIMENTATION; NOISE	IC FABRICATION; IMPACT	Rapid technological learning is critical to commercial success in VLSI semiconductor manufacturing. This learning is done through deliberate activities, especially various types of experimentation. Such experiments are vulnerable to confounding by process noise, caused by process variability. Therefore plants with low noise levels can potentially learn more effectively than high noise plants. Detailed die yield data from five semiconductor plants were examined to estimate process noise levels. A bootstrap simulation was used to estimate the error rates of identical controlled experiments conducted in each plant. Absolute noise levels were high for all but the best plants, leading to lost learning. For example, the probability of overlooking a three percent yield improvement was above twenty percent in all but one plant. Brute-force statistical methods are either expensive or ineffective for dealing with these high noise levels. Depending on the criterion used, there was a four- to ten-fold difference among the plants.		BOHN, RE (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCH INT RELAT & PACIFIC STUDIES,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.

First, we examine the case where capacity is infinite. For this case, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal lead time quote. Second, we consider the case where capacity is finite and the firm processes jobs in first-come-first-served (FCFS) order. We prove the optimality of different forms of control limit policies for the situations where the lead time is dictated by the market and where firms are able to compete on the basis of lead time. Finally, we consider the case where the firm may choose to schedule jobs in other than FCFS order and give conditions under which the optimal due-date-quoting/order-scheduling policy will process jobs in earliest due date (EDD) order.

The measure is applied to data on the forecasts and forecasting methods of a panel of U.S. economists to determine how the benefits of combining vary with the number of forecasts combined, and with the diversity in theories and techniques among the component forecasts.

J	TROUTT, MD				TROUTT, MD			A MAXIMUM DECISIONAL EFFICIENCY ESTIMATION PRINCIPLE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ESTIMATION; INVERSE OPTIMIZATION; INDIRECT CONSENSUS; MULTIATTRIBUTE VALUATION		This paper proposes a systematic approach to certain parameter estimation problems relevant to applied optimization models. A context-specific measure of decision maker performance called decisional efficiency is defined as a function of the unknown parameter vector. The values of this measure are considered to be distributed according to a performance density. Then a principle of Maximum Decisional Efficiency (MDE) is proposed and its relationship to the Maximum Likelihood principle of statistics is discussed. The principle is first-illustrated on a problem of group ideal point estimation. Next, estimation of the ratio of ordering and holding costs in inventories managed by the EOQ model is considered. The results in both these examples are intuitively appealing, suggesting face validity of the principle. A more detailed illustration is developed for the problem of deriving a consensus scoring model for credit applicants which combines the data of more than one loan officer.

Decision variables are diversion of flow at specific nodes and the storage of material in buffers which have to meet upper and lower capacity constraints. Evaluation of a decision is based on utility functions which are assumed to be piecewise linear and concave. The solution is based on a transformation into a network flow problem as suggested by Kuczera (1989). The temporal dimension of the problem is handled by constructing a supergraph with a layer for each time period. These layers are connected by temporal arcs. Thus the problem can be solved entirely by well-known algorithms for the minimum-cost flow problem which yield the optimal solution and determine automatically whether a feasible solution exists or not. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is pseudopolynomial, i.e., linear in the size of the network (measured by nodes, arcs, and buffers), linear in the amount of inflow, and quadratic in the number of time periods under consideration.

This problem arises naturally in the context of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure for the general job shop scheduling problem, as a relaxation of the latter, tighter than the standard one-machine relaxation. The paper first highlights the difference between the two relaxations through some relevant complexity results. Then it introduces a modified Longest Tail Heuristic whose analysis identifies those situations that permit efficient branching. As a result, an optimization algorithm is developed whose performance is comparable to that of the best algorithms for the standard one-machine problem. Embedding this algorithm into a modified version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure that uses the tighter one-machine relaxation discussed here results in a considerable overall improvement in performance on all classes of job shop scheduling problems.

We show that the convergence rate of the variance of the sample mean, and the bias of estimators of the variance of the sample mean, asymptotically depend on the data process only through its marginal variance and the sum of the autocorrelations weighted by their absolute lags. Combining these results with variance results of Goldsman and Meketon, we obtain explicit asymptotic approximations for mse, optimal batch size, optimal mse, and robustness for four quadratic-form estimators of the variance of the sample mean. Our empirical results indicate that the asymptotic approximations are reasonably accurate for sample sizes seen in practice. Although we do not discuss batch-size estimation procedures, the empirical results suggest that the explicit asymptotic batch-size approximation, which depends only on a summary measure (which we refer to as the balance point) of the nonnegative-lag autocorrelations, is a reasonable foundation for such procedures.

Just as the implicit volatility of an asset is revealed by an ordinary call option, the ''implicit beta'' of a stock would be revealed by the price of an option to exchange shares of stock for shares of a market index. Considerable benefits would accrue to those involved with the theory and practice of finance, if and when these exchange options begin trading, due to the availability of instantaneous, up-to-the-minute, precise indicators of firms' systematic risk levels.

J	THALHEIMER, R; ALI, MM				THALHEIMER, R; ALI, MM			THE DEMAND FOR PARIMUTUEL HORSE RACE WAGERING AND ATTENDANCE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PARIMUTUEL WAGERING; LOTTERY; HORSE RACING; DEMAND FOR WAGERING	TIME-SERIES	There has been a long history of patron participation in parimutuel horse race wagering and attendance, which are major recreational products in consumer budgets. In this paper, the demand for parimutuel horse race wagering and attendance has been specified and estimated for both Thoroughbred and Standardbred racetracks in a multistate market area. The data are annual over the period 1960-1987. It is found that demand is price elastic in every case. Racing quality, personal income, the number of racing days, competition from a state lottery, and from professional sports (baseball, basketball, football) are all significant determinants of these demands. Both attendance and wagering are found to increase with an increase in racing quality. However, it seems that the new patrons, attracted by quality racing, tend to wager less than those who attend regularly. The presence of a state lottery is found to have resulted in a substantial loss in attendance as well as in wagering at each of the racetracks. This, in turn, has resulted in a loss in both attendance and wagering-related revenue to racetracks, horsemen at those racetracks, and state governments. Professional sports are estimated to have a negative impact on attendance and wagering demands. For example, an additional 10 days of competition from professional sports in 1987 would have resulted in a 4% decrease in both attendance and wagering. Both attendance and wagering can be increased by lowering the takeout rate from present levels or by offering more quality races.

Our model explicitly incorporates the impact of demand uncertainty, and thus allows us to analyze the implications of uncertainty on the optimal price path, by contrasting the stochastic policy with the corresponding deterministic policy. We begin with an analysis of the general model and then focus on several special cases based on well known demand specifications to gain more specific insights and to suggest directional guidelines for dynamic pricing decisions in an uncertain environment. In general, the degree of impact of demand uncertainty on the optimal pricing policy is determined by the interaction among uncertainty, demand and/or cost dynamics, and the firm's discount rate. Thus, farsighted firms operating under dynamic market conditions with high demand uncertainty, such as high tech companies with innovative products for consumer or industrial markets, should attach particular importance to the formal consideration of uncertainty in their long term pricing decisions.

However, many DSS have grown to the point that the average end user is presented with a bewildering array of information resources that are difficult to manage in an effective manner. As a result users often gravitate to a few familiar models and are unaware of the data resources available to them and how these resources relate to the various models. For example, they may think that a model requires data that is unavailable, when in fact that data has recently been added to the data base or could be calculated from another model. Or they may believe that all of the data needed to execute a set of models is available and find out well into the analysis that it is not. Existing tools for DSS design do not provide an effective and comprehensive foundation for modeling all the components of a DSS, or for addressing all the important DSS analysis and design issues. In this paper we show how a new graph-theoretic structure, called a metagraph, can be used as a unifying basis for addressing many important questions in DSS development and use.

However, few studies have attempted to empirically examine these relationships. The primary goal of this paper is to assess the hypothesis that investments in information technology are at least partially responsible for one important organizational change, the shift of economic activity to smaller firms. We examine this hypothesis using industry-level data on IT capital and four measures of firm size, including employees and sales per firm. We find broad evidence that investment in IT is significantly associated with subsequent decreases in the average size of firms. We also find that these decreases in firm size are most pronounced two to three years after the IT investment is made.

J	BRYNJOLFSSON, E				BRYNJOLFSSON, E			INFORMATION ASSETS, TECHNOLOGY, AND ORGANIZATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; ORGANIZATION; INFORMATION ASSETS; CONTRACT THEORY	MARKETS; COSTS	Although there is good reason to expect that the growth of information work and information technology will significantly affect the trade-offs inherent in different structures for organizing work, the theoretical basis for these changes remains poorly understood. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing the incentive effects of different ownership arrangement in the spirit of the Grossman-Hart-Moore (GHM) incomplete contracts theory of the firm. A key departure from earlier approaches is the inclusion of a role for an ''information asset,'' analogous to the GHM treatment of property. This approach highlights the organizational significance of information ownership and information technology. For instance, using this framework, one can determine when 1) informed workers are more likely to be owners than employees of firms, 2) increased flexibility of assets will facilitate decentralization, and 3) the need for centralized coordination will lead to centralized ownership. The framework developed sheds light on some of the empirical findings regarding the relationship between information technology and firm size and clarifies the relationship between coordination mechanisms and the optimal distribution of asset ownership. While many implications are still unexplored and untested, building on the incomplete contracts approach appears to be a promising avenue for the careful, methodical analysis of human organizations and the impact of new technologies.

These hypotheses are tested using data collected from the Initial Public Offering (IPO) documents of a sample of 52 new ventures in the telecommunications equipment industry. This industry has experienced a great deal of technological change as computer and telephone technologies have merged allowing a variety of new ventures to successfully enter the industry. The results suggest that new ventures pursuing broad cost leadership strategies were more successful. Investments in innovation in terms of relative R&D expenditures were also related to higher performance. Finally, significant interaction effects between investments in innovation and competitive strategies and performance were found.

The appropriate values of these parameters are influenced by the accuracy of forecasts over the lead time, the variability of processing time and the degree of congestion, together with the costs of inventory and shortages. These influences are explored using stochastic models of a single stage manufacturing system for which work release is controlled using MRP. The major conclusion is that safety time is usually only preferable to safety stock when it is possible to make accurate forecasts of future required shipments over the lead time, otherwise safety stock is more robust in coping with changes in customer requirements in the lead time or with fluctuations in forecasts of lead time demand.

In the framework of the economic lot scheduling problem with stochastic demand, we develop an optimization-based model that considers capacity slack, safety stock, and overtime explicitly, and has the objective of minimizing the expected cost per unit time of inventory, overtime, and, where applicable, setup costs. The solution is a continuous-time production plan that consists of a time-dependent inventory trajectory for each of the parts, including the placement of planned idle time in the schedule. We consider schedule stability to be desirable because of potential effects on upstream and downstream operations in multistage production settings. Thus, the plan also has certain characteristics that contribute to achieving stability. Our results on the relative merits of capacity slack and safety stock indicate that capacity slack in the form of planned idle time is not a cost-effective hedge against demand uncertainty in this context. Thus, it is essential that management carefully identify and evaluate other reasons for including idle time in a plan, and use the idle time effectively. For managers who face situations not fully represented by our model, this paper provides analytic results that will guide them in the placement of planned idle time and the choice of safety stock levels.

J	CURRAN, M				CURRAN, M			VALUING ASIAN AND PORTFOLIO OPTIONS BY CONDITIONING ON THE GEOMETRIC MEAN PRICE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						OPTION PRICING; CONDITIONING; EXOTIC OPTIONS; ASIAN OPTIONS		The valuation of Asian, or average price, options and of European options on portfolios in a ''Black-Scholes'' environment has given researchers trouble. The difficulty with these problems is that the probability distribution of the variable which determines the option payoff at expiration, a sum of correlated lognormal random variables, has no closed-form representation. For the Asian case the approach generally taken has been to approximate the distribution of the arithmetic average price, while for the portfolio option case, attempts have focused on discretizing the joint distribution of the terminal prices of the assets comprising the portfolio and approximating the expected risk-neutral option payoff with a discrete sum. These approaches are not entirely satisfactory. The distribution-approximating procedures for Asian options are not very accurate for some cases, while the computational requirements for obtaining a reasonably accurate estimate using the discretizing or multinomial approaches for portfolio options become excessive as the number of assets rises above four or five, because the computation time is exponential in the number of assets. This paper presents a method based on conditioning on the geometric mean price which results in a far more efficient technique for valuing these options.

A job may be completed after its due date, but not after its deadline, in which case it is tardy. A branch and bound algorithm is proposed to find a schedule which minimizes the weighted number of tardy jobs. It uses lower bounds which are derived using the dynamic programming state-space relaxation method. Computational experience with test problems having up to 300 jobs indicates that the lower bounds are extremely effective in restricting the size of the branch and bound search tree.

As one test case of the theory, this study examines firms' applied research and development activities. Evolutionary theory suggests that firms within an industry will tend both to persist and to differ in the amount of effort they devote to various R&D applications. A test of the hypothesis of persisent differences in R&D, using uniquely detailed data from the petroleum industry, provides support for evolutionary theory.

We propose confidence intervals for the case in which the ratio is estimated by using independent, identically distributed random pairs with bounded and ordered components. Emphasis is given to the case in which each component can be expressed as the product of a Bernoulli and a bounded random variable. The proposed intervals result from distribution-free bounds on error probabilities, are valid for every sample size, and their asymptotic width decreases at the same rate as that of confidence intervals based on the central limit theorem. We evaluate their performance by means of two experiments. The first considers the estimation of the probability that a path in a directed network is shortest while the second considers the estimation of the distribution of the inventory level in a stationary inventory system with periodic review. The experiments show that the intervals are conservative with superior coverage for small sample sizes (less-than-or-equal-to 50).

Specific rules encountered in the literature and used in practice are invariably symmetric in the sense that the expected score for a perfectly-calibrated probability assessor (or model generating probabilities) is minimized at a probability of one-half. A family of asymmetric scoring rule that provide better measures of the degree of skill inherent in the probabilities and render scores that are more comparable in different situations is developed here. One member of this family, a quadratic asymmetric rule, is applied to evaluate an extensive set of precipitation probability forecasts from the U.S. National Weather Service. Connections to previous characterizations of proper scoring rules are investigated, and some relevant issues pertaining to the design of specific asymmetric rules for particular inferential and decision-making problems are discussed briefly.

Survey data from 584 establishments engaged in the machining process in 21 different industries are used to construct and test an empirical model that takes into account product characteristics, the type of technology (computer-programmable automation or conventionally controlled) machines, the extent of technological change at the plant, process-specific characteristics such as the scale of operations and degree of customization, labor policies, and structural features of the organization of work. The results indicate that there is a significant efficiency advantage from using programmable automation technology and that technological advantages accumulate with experience and with the repeated opportunities for learning associated with large volume and frequent product changes. The most efficient use of this technology occurs in plants with work practices that involve a higher ratio of machines to workers (as in a cellular approach to manufacturing) and allow production workers to perform programming tasks to a greater degree. Unionized plants are also significantly more efficient than non-union plants.

These networks include serial, assembly, and one-warehouse multi-retailer systems. We obtain the bounds through novel cost-allocation schemes. We evaluate the bounds' performance for one-warehouse multi-retailer systems by comparing them with simple, heuristic policies. The bounds are quite tight for systems with a small number of retailers. We also present simplified proofs of known optimality results for serial and assembly systems.

More importantly, plants and firms with greater strategic manufacturing focus, regardless of specific emphasis (e.g., cost of quality), scheduled fewer part numbers on new flexible automation systems. This suggests that product focus and strategic focus are related in plants producing discrete parts. When flexibility is emphasized as a strategic manufacturing focus, new automation systems are significantly more likely to have shorter change-over times per part family. In general, part family-changeover time ratios appear to have the greatest potential of measures evaluated for building a useful theory of flexibility in discrete parts manufacturing. An evaluation of changes made in part types and part families during the implementation period showed that product flexibility is pursued as a way to reduce high labor costs in manufacturing. These plants accomplished this end by increasing the number of parts scheduled on new systems. Implications for strategic management of flexibility and scope are presented.

In this article we develop a heuristic scheduling policy for the multi-machine extension of the same problem. We integrate the concepts of the Dynamic Cycle Lengths Heuristic with a nonlinear integer optimization model to obtain an overall scheduling policy that allocates items to machines and schedules production quantities during the next time period. We report promising performance in limited simulation tests of the policy.

In order to realize the competitive edge of flexible systems, manufacturing management has to deal effectively with the greater complexity that flexibility brings about. One of the key factors for the success of a flexible system is the management of the product set flow. If the product flow is poorly managed, products may have long manufacturing lead times, and materials may spend a large amount of time in queues as work in process. In such a situation, most of the competitive potential of the flexible system may be lost. But if the flow of materials through the production/assembly stations is carefully synchronized, with materials moving smoothly and continuously from one operation to the next, then it is possible to attain short manufacturing lead times and little waiting. We refer to this operating condition as synchronized flow.

J	KANNAN, PK; SANCHEZ, SM				KANNAN, PK; SANCHEZ, SM			COMPETITIVE MARKET STRUCTURES - A SUBSET-SELECTION ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKET STRUCTURE; MOVER-STAYER MODEL; SUBSET SELECTION; SCANNER DATA	VARIETY-SEEKING; PANEL DATA; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; LOYALTY	Market structure models are used to identify submarkets or to test for the presence of submarkets where within-group competition is much stronger than across group competition. The implicit assumption in such models is that the brands in a submarket compete on the basis of their shared product features. However, if significant variety-seeking effects exist in the market, such an assumption may not be valid. We present a model based on a subset selection procedure for analyzing competitive market structures and develop tests of significance for variety-seeking effects present in the market. For each brand in the market, the subset selection procedure identifies sets (submarkets) of brands that are in ''close'' competition. The competitive market structure is defined by the possibly overlapping submarkets that are identified for each brand and the model provides insights on whether the brands in a submarket are of a reinforcing or a variety-seeking kind. The application of our model to two different consumer packaged goods markets highlights its contribution relative to extent methods.

J	MACCRIMMON, KR; WAGNER, C				MACCRIMMON, KR; WAGNER, C			STIMULATING IDEAS THROUGH CREATIVITY SOFTWARE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						IDEA GENERATION; CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING; CREATIVITY; DECISION MAKING; COMPUTER SOFTWARE	SUPPORT; MEETINGS	A central task of management is decision making and a crucial aspect of decision making is having good alternatives from which to choose. This paper investigates whether computer-based procedures for idea generation can help individuals to develop solution alternatives more creatively. Our conceptual framework considers creative processes, environments, outputs, and individuals. In particular, generating alternatives is viewed as a process of ''making connections'' - internal connections among problem elements and external connections between a problem and its environment. We have developed a computer program (GENI) which incorporates a variety of techniques to assist in making these different types of connections. The program is described and an experimental test with several managerial problems is presented. The results show that use of the program leads to the development of significantly more creative alternatives than does a control treatment. There is an amplification effect in that the performance of the more creative individuals is improved the most. Thus the findings suggest that computerized idea generation leads to more creative alternatives resulting in potentially better managerial decisions.

The recently standardized SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) technology has made rings the preferred architecture for designing survivable networks. The network design problem is very complex in nature, because it involves not only the configuration of rings at the logical level, but also the mapping of this configuration into physical fiber paths. This paper deals with the problem of finding optimal clusters of offices, which can be used as the basis for designing logical rings. A mathematical model of the problem is presented, and a heuristic solution based on the tabu search framework is developed to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

In almost all decision making problems, there are several criteria for judging possible alternatives. The main concern of the Decision Maker (DM) is to fulfill his conflicting goals while satisfying the constraints of the system. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (AF-ANN) approach to solve discrete Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. The AF-ANN is used to capture and represent the DM's preferences and then to select the most desirable alternative. The AF-ANN can adjust and improve its representation as more information from the DM becomes available. We begin with the assumption that an AF-ANN topology is given, i.e., specific numbers of nodes and links are predetermined. To adjust the parameters of the AF-ANN, we present an iterative learning algorithm consisting of two steps: (a) generating a direction, and (b) a one-dimensional search along that direction. We then present a methodology to obtain the most appropriate AF-ANN topology and set its parameters. The procedure starts with a small number of nodes and links and then adaptively increases the number of nodes and links until the proper topology is obtained. Furthermore, when the set of training patterns (alternatives with their associated evaluations by the DM) changes, the AF-ANN model can adapt itself by re-training or expanding the existing model. Some illustrative examples are presented. To solve discrete MCDM problems by an AF-ANN, we show how to incorporate basic properties of efficiency, concavity, and convexity into the AF-ANN. We formulate the MCDM problems and use the AF-ANN to rank the set of discrete alternatives where each alternative is associated with a set of conflicting and noncommensurate criteria. We present a method for solving discrete MCDM problems through AF-ANNs which consists of: (a) formulating and assessing the utility function by eliciting information from the DM and then training the AF-ANN, and (b) ranking and rating alternatives by using the trained AF-ANN model. Some computational experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.

J	LECUYER, P; GLYNN, PW				LECUYER, P; GLYNN, PW			STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION BY SIMULATION - CONVERGENCE PROOFS FOR THE GI/G/1 QUEUE IN STEADY-STATE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DISCRETE EVENT SYSTEMS; STOCHASTIC APPROXIMATION; GRADIENT ESTIMATION; OPTIMIZATION; STEADY-STATE	INFINITESIMAL PERTURBATION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; GRADIENT ESTIMATION; ALGORITHM	Approaches like finite differences with common random numbers, infinitesinal perturbation analysis, and the likelihood ratio method have drawn a great deal of attention recently as ways of estimating the gradient of a performance measure with respect to continuous parameters in a dynamic stochastic system. In this paper, we study the use of such estimators in stochastic approximation algorithms, to perform so-called ''single-run optimizations'' of steady-state systems. Under mild conditions, for an objective function that involves the mean system time in a GI/G/1 queue, we prove that many variants of these algorithms converge to the minimizer. In most cases, however, the simulation length must be increased from iteration to iteration; otherwise the algorithm may converge to the wrong value. One exception is a particular implementation of infinitesimal perturbation analysis, for which the single-run optimization converges to the optimum even with a fixed (and small) number of ends of service per iteration. As a by-product of our convergence proofs, we obtain some properties of the derivative estimators that could be of independent interest. Our analysis exploits the regenerative structure of the system, but our derivative estimation and optimization algorithms do not always take advantage of that regenerative structure. In a companion paper, we report numerical experiments with an M/M/1 queue, which illustrate the basic convergence properties and possible pitfalls of the various techniques.

J	ERNST, LR				ERNST, LR			APPORTIONMENT METHODS FOR THE HOUSE-OF-REPRESENTATIVES AND THE COURT CHALLENGES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						BIAS; DIVISOR METHODS; EQUAL PROPORTIONS; OPTIMALITY; PAIRWISE TESTS; US CONSTITUTION		Four different methods have been used to apportion the seats in the United States House of Representatives among the states following the decennial census. The current method, the method of equal proportions, has been used for each census since 1940. In 1991, for the first time in U.S. history, the constitutionality of an apportionment method was challenged in court, by Montana and Massachusetts in separate cases. Montana proposed two methods as alternatives to equal proportions, the methods of harmonic means and smallest divisors, while Massachusetts proposed the method of major fractions. On March 31, 1992, in a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of equal proportions. This author wrote the declarations on the mathematical and statistical issues used by the defense in these cases. The declarations in the Massachusetts case contain several new theoretical and empirical results. This paper discusses the technical issues in these eases together with a brief history of the apportionment problem.

When informational asymmetries arise between employers (supervisors) and employees (subordinates) about future states, questions arise as to whether and when resolving these informational asymmetries produces economic gains. To address these questions, I use a two-period principal agent contracting framework in which the agent (employee) receives imperfect private information about the second period state in the first period, and make a welfare comparison between two alternative communication regimes. In the ''delayed communication regime,'' a report from the agent is considered only for second period contract. In the ''early communication regime,'' the report is considered for first period contracting as well. This regime can therefore be viewed as encouraging participation in long-term contracts. I identify conditions under which the early communication regime is strictly preferable to the delayed communication regime. Further, given some additional structure on the agent's preferences, this result obtains even if the agent can access capital markets to smooth inter-temporal consumption. Finally, I examine the setting in which the principal, at the time of contracting, has the option of whether or not to install an information system that provides the agent with private information about the future period state. I identify conditions under which installing the information system, and resolving the consequent information asymmetry through participation, is strictly preferable to not installing the information system.

J	CHEN, FR; ZHENG, YS				CHEN, FR; ZHENG, YS			EVALUATING ECHELON STOCK (R,NQ) POLICIES IN SERIAL PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEMS WITH STOCHASTIC DEMAND	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTIECHELON INVENTORY; FACILITY-IN-SERIES; BATCH ORDERING; REORDER-POINT ORDER-QUANTITY SYSTEM	MODELS	This paper studies echelon stock (R, nQ) policies in serial production/inventory systems with stochastic demand. We provide a recursive procedure to compute the steady state echelon inventory levels of the systems, which can be used to evaluate the long-run average holding and backorder costs as well as other performance measures. The procedure is based upon an observation of a relationship between the inventory status of adjacent stages in a serial system. We also derive exact formulas for replenishment frequencies and setup costs. Our results apply to both continuous-review systems with compound Poisson demand and periodic-review systems with independent, identically distributed demands. A preliminary numerical study was conducted to explore the cost effectiveness of echelon stock (R, nQ) policies. For two-stage systems with simple Poisson demand, we compared among the minimum costs of echelon stock (R, nQ) policies, a lower bound on the minimum achievable costs, and the minimum costs of installation stock (R, nQ) policies. Finally, we present a modification of an existing approximate evaluation procedure.

The algorithm considers a sequence of adjacent solutions obtained by repeatedly removing a vertex from its current route and reinserting it into another route. This is done by means of a generalized insertion procedure previously developed by the authors. During the course of the algorithm, infeasible solutions are allowed.

Our analysis of shipment data in the automobile industry suggests that shipment performance degrades substantially due to increases in part variety and trading partners from diverse industries. However, investments in information technology to support both the sharing of JIT schedules and the establishment of integrated information links are related to significant reduction in the level of shipment discrepancies.

Based on the accuracy desired, the first heuristic evaluates a specified number of points. The relative error is within a bound that approaches 1/(root 2 In 2) - 1 approximate to 2.014%. The complexity of the heuristic is O(n) for a fixed number of evaluations. Although our bound only approaches the one of Roundy (1985), when only a small number of points are evaluated, our method is faster. We show that the bound for our procedure and two bounds proposed by Roundy (1985) are tight. The second heuristic pertains to a class of policies called stationary interval policies. For this class of policies, we develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme where the relative error is within epsilon > 0, and the computational effort increases as a linear function of 1/root epsilon. Computational experiments show that these heuristics perform well in practice.		LU, L (reprint author), OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT IND & SYST ENGN,COLUMBUS,OH 43210, USA.

Using Kalman Filter estimation, we show that teams' abilities exhibit substantial week-to-week variation during the season. This provides an ideal environment in which to study how agents learn from past information. While we do not find strong evidence of market inefficiency, we are able to make several observations on market learning. In particular, agents have more difficulty learning from ''noisy'' observations and appear to weight recent observations less than our statistical model suggests is optimal.

J	MULVEY, JM; ZENIOS, SA				MULVEY, JM; ZENIOS, SA			CAPTURING THE CORRELATIONS OF FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; FINANCE; PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION	This paper develops a framework for managing portfolios of fixed income instruments based on traditional principles from the equities market, i.e., based on diversification. It shows, through an analysis of the high-yield bond market over the period 1987 to 1991, that fixed-income prices could be highly correlated. These correlations can be quantified and integrated, in a systematic way, in an asset/liability management framework. For vanishing fixed income securities, however, we cannot resort to statistical analysis of historical data in order to quantify correlations. The paper develops a forward-looking simulation procedure for capturing correlations. Applications are illustrated for examples from high-yield bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The superiority of the proposed approach over the traditional portfolio immunization techniques is demonstrated in the context of funding an insurance liability stream with mortgage instruments.

While these restrictions are minimal, they lead both to new theoretical results and to simpler proofs of existing ones. The new results, obtained for dominance criteria of any degree, generalize an SSD result of Rothschild-Stiglitz to describe how for any dominance criterion a dominated variable is equal in distribution to a dominated variable plus perturbation terms. If the variables are comparable under FSD the perturbations are downward shift terms, while under SSD (TSD) all but two (three) of the perturbations are zero mean disturbance terms (noise). Under SSD the remaining perturbations are shift terms and under TSD noise and shift terms. However, under either SSD or TSD these remaining terms are identically zero if the variables to be compared have equal means. The paper also finds new proofs of well known results relating dominance criteria to preferences.

J	BALACHANDRAN, KR; RADHAKRISHNAN, S				BALACHANDRAN, KR; RADHAKRISHNAN, S			EXTENSIONS TO CLASS DOMINANCE CHARACTERISTICS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SERVICE CENTER; MULTIPLE CLASSES; DELAY COSTS; OPTIMIZATION; PRIORITIES		Balachandran and Schaefer (1979) show that if in the individual optimum class A dominates with a first come first serve queue, there could exist cases where in the public optimum class B dominates. We derive conditions under which providing a nonpreemptive priority allows both classes of users to use the facility and get a higher expected public net benefit than the first come first serve queue. The class that is provided the higher priority may or may not be the class that dominates in the public optimum under the first come first serve queue. That means that introducing a priority scheme may switch the class that is given preference in the public optimum. It is shown that there exist situations where the class that is granted the higher priority for service could be levied a lower price than the class that is granted the lower priority. In the case where the users alone have perfect information on the value from using the facility, we derive conditions under which a non preemptive priority is superior to the first come first serve queue. The preemptive priority resume queue is not necessarily always superior to the first come first serve queue.

Conceptually, an order-of-entry effect implies that the share advantage of a market pioneer over the second entrant is constant, regardless of the length of time the pioneer is alone in the market or the length of time since the entry of the second brand. We argue that pioneering advantage is also related to a brand's length of time in the market: the longer the brand's time in market (during which time it can impact consumer learning and influence consumer perceptions and preferences), the greater its relative share advantage. We present a parsimonious model of this time-in-market effect and test our model using two data sources: cross-category data collected and analyzed by Urban et al. (1986) and regional roll-out data for a single product category.	STANFORD UNIV,GRAD SCH BUSINESS,STANFORD,CA 94305	BROWN, CL (reprint author), NYU,STERN SCH BUSINESS,NEW YORK,NY 10012, USA.

J	MILTENBURG, GJ; WIJNGAARD, J				MILTENBURG, GJ; WIJNGAARD, J			THE U-LINE LINE BALANCING PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article								The traditional line balancing (LB) problem considers a production line in which stations are arranged consecutively in a line. A balance is determined by grouping tasks into stations while moving forward (or backward) through a precedence network. Recently many production lines are being arranged in a ''U-line,'' as a consequence of the use of just-in-time production principles in many factories. In this paper the U-line LB problem is introduced and modelled, and solution procedures are developed. It is more complex than the traditional LB problem because tasks can be grouped by moving forward, backward, or simultaneously in both directions, through the precedence network. We also show how solution techniques developed for the traditional LB problem can be adapted for use with the new problem. Some computational results for well-known problems from the literature are given.

J	MUHANNA, WA; PICK, RA				MUHANNA, WA; PICK, RA			METAMODELING CONCEPTS AND TOOLS FOR MODEL MANAGEMENT - A SYSTEMS-APPROACH	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MODEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; MODELING ENVIRONMENTS; HIERARCHICAL MODEL DESIGN; SYSTEMS CONCEPTS	LINEAR-PROGRAMMING MODELS; LANGUAGES; SUPPORT	We present a new framework for model management based on system concepts and theory. Underlying the framework is a set of meta-modeling concepts that are useful in capturing the semantics of the modeling process in a modeling environment. These concepts include the notions of a general-model type, type specialization, atomic and composite model verions, model instances, and parameterized versions. We describe these concepts both conceptually and formally and then briefly present a Model Description Language (MDL) that embodies them. While other researchers have suggested some of these concepts primarily in different contexts, this paper makes at least four valuable contributions: (1) the identification of fundamental issues and principles related to model management; (2) the development and enhanced treatment of meta-modeling concepts specifically for model management; (3) the synthesis of those concepts into a coherent, unifying framework for model management; and (4) a demonstration of the practicality of those concepts through a prototype system implementation. Our framework proposes a graph-oriented, nonprocedural, and hierarchical approach for model composition. The framework also supports both model-solver independence and model-data independence. Moreover, it offers general solutions to two critical issues in model management: model-model linkage and model-data linkage. We argue that the system framework can serve as a guide for an effective design of a flexible and extensible model management system. An architecture of such a system and its prototype implementation-called SYMMS-are briefly described. Examples are presented to illustrate the features and advantages of our approach.

The first is concerned with the assignment of days off; the second involves assigning workers to shifts during the day; and the third involves the construction of weekly tours. In many manufacturing facilities, tour scheduling is easy because the start and end times of shifts are invariant, and no work takes place on the weekend. But when daily patterns vary, such as in the airlines, processing, and public service industries, and when part-timers make up a portion of the workforce, the complexity of the overall problem increases dramatically. This paper presents a new methodology for solving the combined shift and days-off scheduling problem when the labor requirements span less than 24 hours per day. We begin with an integer programming formulation and then introduce a set of aggregate variables and related cuts. When the aggregate variables are fixed the original problem decomposes into seven subproblems (one for each day of the week) that are much easier to solve. A partial enumeration scheme and a heuristic for ensuring feasibility are employed to find upper and lower bounds which converge rapidly to near-optima. The methodology is applied to tour scheduling at general mail facilities (GMFs). These facilities are located in most urban areas and process millions of mail pieces daily for local and regional distribution. The model accounts for the principal constraints in the U.S. Postal Service labor contract, including half-hour breaks, minimum full-time to part-time ratios, and variable start times. Also considered are four and five day work weeks, and the possibility of assigning workers across labor categories. A full analysis of the Providence, Rhode Island facility is presented.

The problem of determining efficient joint ordering policies has the same structure as the previously-examined problem of determining the efficient ordering policy for a single product. Efficient joint lot-sizes are independent of prices, and are supported by a range of average-unit prices that permit every possible allocation of the transactions-cost saving between the buyer and the seller. Product bundling supports efficient joint orders across products, just as a quantity discount supports efficient transactions for a single product.

We build upon the experimental view of consumer behavior, and present an innovative modeling approach to studying the dynamics of hedonic consumption experiences. We develop a conceptual framework for the enjoyment of a hedonic experience, in which we propose that the enjoyment of the experience is an outcome of the dynamic interaction between stable individual difference factors, temporary moods, and the emotional content of the experience. We present an application of the conceptual framework in the context of a movie viewing experience. We model the interaction between the temporary moods of an individual and the emotional content of the movie as a stochastic process. This interaction determines the individual's instantaneous emotional states. We develop analytical expressions for the dynamic evolution of the probability distribution of the levels of achieved emotional stimulation, and, through individual difference factors, the expected enjoyment. All measurements are taken prior to watching the movie. We use these measurements to predict individual differences in the ex-post enjoyment of the movie. We present an empirical test of the movie enjoyment model (ENJMOD), and find encouraging results at the individual and segment level. We discuss the implications of our modeling approach for the segmentation and testing of movies, and for the prediction of consumer response to similar experiential products.

The study examines fairness for individuals and for homogeneous groups within the population. It considers fairness both for population benefit-risk profiles and for probability distributions over profiles that reflect uncertainty about outcomes of decisions. The present paper focuses on fairness for profiles in which benefits and risks are not aggregated within groups or across the population. It ties fairness to notions of envy among individuals and groups that are based on individuals' preferences. The sequel will discuss aggregation of benefits and risks along with fairness from an aggregated perspective.

The procedures are based on the method of standardized time series proposed by Schruben and on Stein's two-stage sampling scheme. We prove that our two-stage procedures give rise to asymptotically valid confidence intervals (as the prescribed length of the confidence interval approaches zero and the size of the first stage grows to infinity). The sole assumption required is that the stochastic process satisfy a functional central limit theorem.

In many applications this by-product is modeled as a learning curve; that is, a simple function of time or of cumulative production experience. In an earlier paper we presented an alternative explanation where managers decide what resources to devote to knowledge acquisition. In this paper we expand those results to a situation using a more flexible production technology and emphasizing discounted cost. Our model explains resource and output behavior for a firm that is producing specialized units to contractual order. However, the results are quite general and have implications for investment in research, engineering, science and technology, software development, and worker training. We provide examples where the cost-minimizing producer will choose to invest in knowledge creation early in the production program and then have the rate of investment decline over time. Other interesting results are noted by examining the optimal time paths of the control and state variables in a comparative dynamics analysis.

We consider a series of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) frontiers, and we show when these may be incentive efficient in the sense that they contain all the information that are relevant for optimal incentive provision. The frontiers considered include the so-called constant, decreasing and varying return to scale models, the free disposability and the free replicability models, as well as the increasing and decreasing return to scale models based on a relaxed set of assumptions.

A mathematical model is presented to aid designers in the development of distributed database systems. The model takes into account the pattern of usage of the databases, communication costs in the network, delays due to queuing of data requests, costs for maintaining consistency among the various copies of a database, and storage costs. A solution procedure based on Lagrangian relaxation is proposed to solve the model. Computational results are reported along with several useful observations. The model is applicable to organizations that are considering migration from a centralized to a distributed computing environment.

In our two-stage model, suppliers joining the network in the first stage can gain economic benefit from increased market share or higher price for the primary product. Suppliers encounter negative externalities since the economic benefit accruing to participating suppliers is less for increasingly larger networks. In the first stage, the buyer may experience initial supplier adoption of the network followed by a ''stalling'' problem due to negative externalities. In order to overcome this stalling problem, the buyer may find it optimal to subsidize some suppliers' costs to join the network in the second stage. We characterize the buyer's optimal second stage subsidy policy and show the conditions under which the buyer will find it optimal to offer a subsidy. If the suppliers have some positive ex ante expectation of a second stage subsidy, the growth of the network will be retarded in the first stage resulting in suboptimal profits for the buyer.

We investigate the problem of dynamically pricing such inventories when demand is price sensitive and stochastic and the firm's objective is to maximize expected revenues. Examples that fit this framework include retailers selling fashion and seasonal goods and the travel and leisure industry, which markets space such as seats on airline flights, cabins on vacation cruises, and rooms in hotels that become worthless if not sold by a specific time. We formulate this problem using intensity control and obtain structural monotonicity results for the optimal intensity (resp., price) as a function of the stock level and the length of the horizon. For a particular exponential family of demand functions, we find the optimal pricing policy in closed form. For general demand functions, we find an upper bound on the expected revenue based on analyzing the deterministic version of the problem and use this bound to prove that simple, fixed price policies are asymptotically optimal as the volume of expected sales tends to infinity. Finally, we extend our results to the case where demand is compound Poisson; only a finite number of prices is allowed; the demand rate is time varying; holding costs are incurred and cash flows are discounted; the initial stock is a decision variable; and reordering, overbooking, and random cancellations are allowed.

J	KWON, C; TEW, JD				KWON, C; TEW, JD			STRATEGIES FOR COMBINING ANTITHETIC VARIATES AND CONTROL VARIATES IN DESIGNED SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ANTITHETIC VARIATES; CONTROL VARIATES; SIMULATION; VARIANCE REDUCTION		In this paper we examine three methods for combining the variance reduction techniques of antithetic variates and control variates to estimate the mean response in a designed simulation experiment. In Combined Method I, we perform h independent pairs of simulation runs as follows-on the second run of each such pair, we use random number streams that are antithetic (complementary) to the streams used on the first run of the pair to drive the non-control-variate components of the simulation model; and we use independent random number streams to drive the control-variate components of the simulation model. In Combined Method II, we also perform h independent pairs of runs; but on each pair of runs we use independent random number streams to drive the non-control-variate model components, and we use antithetic random number streams to drive the control-variate components. In Combined Method III, all of the random number streams driving the second run of each pair of runs are antithetic to the streams driving the first run of the pair. For each of these three methods we derive the variance of the resulting estimator of the mean response to make a theoretical comparison of the efficiency of each method. We implemented these three methods, along with the classical method of control variates, in a simulation model of a resource-constrained activity network to show how each combined method is implemented in practice and to evaluate the performance of each combined method experimentally. The results indicate that: (a) Combined Method III outperformed all other methods, and (b) the effectiveness of Combined Method III as well as the choice of whether to use Combined Method I or Combined Method II depends on the degree of correlation between the control variates and the response.

Although many techniques exist for helping decision makers to select among projects, little attention has been given to processes for identifying improved alternatives based on clearly articulated stakeholder values. In this paper we describe a general process to inform controversial social decisions by first structuring stakeholder objectives and then using this information to create policy alternatives.

At the heart of this effort is the goal of automating virtually all of the letter mail by 1995. This means reading, sorting, and then sequencing each mail piece to the order in which it will be delivered by the carrier with only a minimum of manual labor. In support of this goal, a series of long-term planning models has been developed to help select equipment and plan for its use at the more than 250 general mail facilities (GMF) throughout the nation. This paper reports on one of the central studies underlying this effort. Because of the size and complexity of the facility design problem, a hierarchical approach was followed. Three interrelated models were developed starting with a mixed integer linear program to derive equipment needs and initial machine schedules. The latter are post-processed in two stages to produce implementable schedules that reflect current practice. An auxiliary linear program and a heuristic were constructed for this purpose. The models and analysis conducted are demonstrated with data obtained from the Providence GMF. The results indicate that near optimal solutions can be found quite efficiently and are expected to lead to substantial savings over the 10-year planning horizon.

We develop a procedure to estimate a leader's price rule, which is optimal given a sales target objective, and allows for the inclusion of demand forecasts. We illustrate our estimation procedure by calibrating this optimal price rule for both the leader and the follower using data on past sales and prices from the mid-size sedan segment of the U.S. automobile market. Our results suggest that a leader-follower system (Stackelberg) seems more consistent with the pricing behavior in this market, than a mutually independent pricing rule (Nash). We also find that our optimal price rule explains this market data better than other pricing schemes that do not account for optimizing behavior on the part of the leader and the follower.

The market consists of customer segments with different valuations for product quality. We demonstrate that a higher quality and a higher price of each product in the line convey the firm's advantage to potential competition and prevents entry. We discuss implications for optimal product line selection when customers 'self-select' a product from the line. When product quality change is costly, the superior incumbent continues to select a higher quality and price for each product in the line to credibly substantiate its competitive advantage, though the distortions necessary from the optimal values are lower than before. After informative signalling and deterring entry, the firm retains the higher quality product line.

J	LAU, HS; KLETKE, MG				LAU, HS; KLETKE, MG			A DECISION-SUPPORT SOFTWARE ON BIDDING FOR JOB INTERVIEWS IN COLLEGE PLACEMENT OFFICES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM; BIDDING; MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING	MODEL	Many university placement offices employ a bidding system to allocate on-campus recruiter interview slots to students. Typically, a student is given (say) 700 points each week to bid on the firms visiting that week. Interview slots for each firm are assigned beginning with the highest bidder until all slots are filled. This paper describes the mathematical modeling behind a decision support system for helping students to bid in such a system. It has three components. The first component elicits a student's utilities of getting an interview with the various firms. The second component estimates the probability of getting an interview with a particular firm for a given bid amount. The final component considers our bidding problem as the maximization of a student's expected utility, which can be formulated as a nonlinear integer programming (IP) problem. It is shown that this IP problem can be transformed into a number of nonlinear programming problems without integer requirements, which can then be solved very rapidly to give on-line bidding recommendations to a large number of students.

We are given an undirected network containing two types of nodes-primary and secondary-and fixed costs for installing either a primary or a secondary facility on each edge. Primary nodes require higher grade interconnections than secondary nodes, using the more expensive primary facilities. The TLND problem seeks a minimum cost connected design that spans all the nodes, and connects primary nodes via edges containing primary facilities; the design.can use either primary or secondary edges to connect the secondary nodes. The TLND problem generalizes the well-known Steiner network problem and the hierarchical network design problem. In this paper, we study the relationship between alternative model formulations for this problem (e.g., directed and undirected models), and analyze the worst-case performance for a composite TLND heuristic based upon solving embedded subproblems (e.g., minimum spanning tree and either Steiner tree or shortest path subproblems). When the ratio of primary to secondary costs is the same for all edges and when we solve the embedded subproblems optimally, the worst-case performance ratio of the composite TLND heuristic is 4/3. This result applies to the hierarchical network design problem with constant primary-to-secondary cost ratio since its subproblems are shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems. For more general situations, we express the TLND heuristic worst-case ratio in terms of the performance of any heuristic used to solve the embedded Steiner tree subproblem. A companion paper develops and tests a dual ascent procedure that generates tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of a multi-level extension of this problem.

This approach is employed to study the relative performance characteristics of the four leading algorithmic and heuristic alternatives to solve the Linear Cost Generalized Assignment Problem (LCGAP) against a newly developed heuristic, Variable-Depth Search Heuristic (VDSH). In assessing the relative effectiveness of the prominent solution methodologies and VDSH under the effects of various problem characteristics, we devise a carefully designed experimentation of state-of-the-art implementations; through a rigorous statistical analysis we identify the most efficient method(s) for commonly studied LCGAPs, and determine the effect on solution time and quality of problem class and size.

We show that if preferences are defined via a collection of attributes, then, under common conditions, the principle of optimality is valid if and only if the preferences can be represented by a linear (value) function over the attributes. Consequently, an interactive programming method is suggested which assesses the value function while using the principle of optimality to efficiently search for an optimal path.

J	BONETT, DG; WOODWARD, JA				BONETT, DG; WOODWARD, JA			SEQUENTIAL DEFECT REMOVAL SAMPLING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						IMPERFECT INSPECTION; NONLINEAR STATISTICAL MODEL; QUALITY MANAGEMENT		Standard inspection methods underestimate the true number of defects or nonconformities in a complex product (e.g., automobile, mobile home, airplane, circuit board, computer program) when an inspector is unable to identify every defect with certainty. A nonlinear statistical model with a nonlinear constraint is developed for estimating the unknown number of defects in a product when inspection is imperfect. A sequential defect removal sampling plan is defined in which two or more inspectors examine in sequence a product or sample of products and then mark or correct any observed defects prior to the next inspection. The number of defects identified by each inspector provides the information needed to estimate the number of defects in the product in addition to the number of defects that have eluded all inspectors. A goodness-of-fit test of model assumptions is presented. A test of hypothesis regarding the unknown number of defects in quality improvement experiments also is described.

First, capacity is often purchased in the form of equipment which comes only in a few discrete sizes. Second, some or all of the capacity may be replaced periodically due to the availability of better and cheaper equipment, or due to deterioration and increased operating costs of older equipment. Finally, some capacity may be disposed due to declining demand. We present integer programming formulations that model all of these aspects. We identify special structures in these formulations that are then exploited to develop efficient procedures for solving the linear relaxation optimally. The solution to the linear relaxation together with a heuristic interchange procedure are used in a branch-and-bound procedure to obtain optimal solutions. Computational results are presented that establish the effectiveness of the procedures in solving realistic problems to optimality.

Spacefilling curves make it possible to exchange any two departments and to use more powerful exchange routines than two-way or three-way exchanges. We also further enhance CRAFT by controlling department shapes, and (with multiple floors) by allowing ''flexible'' departmental area requirements. Although the algorithm we present can be used for any single-floor or multi-floor facility layout problem, its primary target is production facilities. A tailored version of the algorithm was successfully tested and used in a large, multi-floor production facility. The algorithm differs significantly from two previous extensions of CRAFT to multi-floor facilities.

J	DEGROOTE, X				DEGROOTE, X			THE FLEXIBILITY OF PRODUCTION PROCESSES - A GENERAL FRAMEWORK	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FLEXIBILITY; OPERATIONS STRATEGY; LATTICE PROGRAMMING; QUEUING; LOT-SIZING	TECHNOLOGY; CAPACITY; STRATEGY; MODEL	Various models have been developed over the years to analyze the many facets of the flexibility of production and operations systems. This paper proposes a general framework for the modeling and analysis of flexibility. The argument hinges upon the distinction between flexibility-a property of the technology-and diversity-a property of the environment in which the technology is operated. Flexibility is characterized as a hedge against diversity. Intuitive strategic properties that are conventionally attributed to flexibility are shown to follow directly from this framework. As illustrated by the different examples that are discussed, many existing models can be naturally interpreted in this context. As an application, the effect of load imbalance on a set of parallel machines is analyzed. The problem sheds light on the role of flexibility in queuing network and lot-sizing models of production.

This paper studies rule processing strategies in expert database systems involving rules that are conditional on joins of relational data. Auxiliary constructs for processing join rules are proposed, and a framework of join rule processing strategies is developed. Cost functions of several strategies are derived based on a stochastic model that characterizes the arrival processes of transactions and queries to the database.

J	ZENGER, TR				ZENGER, TR			EXPLAINING ORGANIZATIONAL DISECONOMIES OF SCALE IN RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT - AGENCY PROBLEMS AND THE ALLOCATION OF ENGINEERING TALENT, IDEAS, AND EFFORT BY FIRM SIZE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DISECONOMIES OF SCALE; COMPENSATION; JOB MOBILITY; SELF-SELECTION; AGENCY THEORY; FIRM SIZE AND INNOVATION	EMPLOYER SIZE; PERFORMANCE; COSTS; COMPENSATION; INTEGRATION; MARKETS; REWARD	The comparative efficiency and success of small firms in R&D remains largely unexplained. This paper empirically examines scale diseconomies in offering employment contracts as an explanation for diseconomies of scale in R&D. The paper argues that small firms more efficiently resolve the severe agency problems of hidden information and hidden behavior in R&D. Small firms more efficiently offer contracts that reward performance than large firms, and consequently, small firms attract and retain engineers with higher ability and skill. Further, small firms through these more performance-contingent contracts induce higher levels of effort than large firms. The study tests and generally confirms these hypotheses using data collected from 912 current and former engineering employees of two large high-technology companies.

J	CASEY, JT				CASEY, JT			BUYERS PRICING BEHAVIOR FOR RISKY ALTERNATIVES - ENCODING PROCESSES AND PREFERENCE REVERSALS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						JUDGMENT; DECISION MAKING; RISK; PREFERENCE REVERSAL	EXPECTED UTILITY; CHOICE; DECISION; PSYCHOLOGY; MODEL; BIAS	Numerous studies have examined individuals' minimum selling prices or certainty equivalents for lotteries as measures of preference, but few have examined maximum buying prices. Because every transaction involves a buyer as well as a seller, buyers' pricing behavior is of interest in its own right. Two prospect theory based descriptive models of maximum buying prices-the integration and segregation models-are developed from different assumptions about cognitive encoding processes. The models were tested experimentally using an incentive-compatible cash payoff scheme in which maximum buying prices for bets and choices between bets were elicited from subjects. Surprisingly, observed maximum buying prices were far below expected values even for bets with probabilities of winning near 1.0. This suggests buyers are strongly influenced by loss aversion and that the conventional assumption that the buying price for a risky alternative is a reduction in the alternative's payoffs fails to describe behavior. Instead, it appears subjects predominately employed a segregation encoding process in which the buying price was encoded separately from the bet's payoffs and treated as a sure loss. However, an additional result was not explained adequately by either encoding model: Buying prices were less risk averse than choices for $3 expected value bets-creating preference reversals of the standard kind (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971)-but more risk averse for $100 expected value bets-creating reverse preference reversals (Casey 1991). Implications for the scale compatibility principle (Tversky et al. 1988) are discussed. Two theoretical approaches are outlined which offer promise in the development of a unified model of price judgments and choice preferences under risk.

Ruefli (1991) has suggested that under the assumption of stable distributions there is the possibility of spurious correlation in estimating the risk-return relationship in mean-variance terms. This comment identifies the commonalities between mean square error and variance measures, shows that the former measure is subject to many of the problems of the latter, and presents further evidence regarding the likelihood of spurious correlation in industry studies of risk and return. The results suggest an alternative and more parsimonious explanation for Oviatt and Bauerschmidt's findings as well as for the findings reported in the wider strategic management research literature.

J	KEEFER, DL				KEEFER, DL			CERTAINTY EQUIVALENTS FOR 3-POINT DISCRETE-DISTRIBUTION APPROXIMATIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; APPROXIMATION OF EXPECTED UTILITIES; CERTAINTY EQUIVALENTS; PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS	DECISION-ANALYSIS; RISK; UNCERTAINTY	Three-point discrete-distribution approximations are often used in decision and risk analyses to represent probability distributions for continuous random variables-e.g., as probability nodes in decision or probability trees. Performance evaluations of such approximations have generally been based on their accuracies in estimating moments for the underlying distributions. However, moment-based comparisons for recently proposed approximations have been limited. Moreover, very little research has addressed the accuracies of any such approximations in representing expected utilities or certainty equivalents of the underlying distributions. This is of potential concern since recent research shows three-point discrete-distribution approximations exist that match the first several moments of an underlying distribution exactly while, counter-intuitively, approximating its certainty equivalents poorly. This paper compares the best two approximations for estimating means and variances identified in an earlier study with promising approximations proposed more recently. Specifically, it examines how accurately six simple general-purpose three-point approximations represent certainty equivalents for continuous random variables as the level of risk aversion is varied, as well as how accurately they estimate means and variances. The results show that several of these are quite accurate over a variety of test distributions when the level of risk aversion and the characteristics of the distributions are within reasonable bounds. Their robust performance is significant for decision analysis practice.		KEEFER, DL (reprint author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV,COLL BUSINESS,DEPT DECIS & INFORMAT SYST,TEMPE,AZ 85287, USA.

J	SHWARTZ, M; LENARD, ML				SHWARTZ, M; LENARD, ML			IMPROVING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES IN-HOSPITAL PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS THROUGH EQUILIBRIUM PRICING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						HOSPITAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS; ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM MODELS	DIAGNOSIS-RELATED GROUPS	Under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) implemented by Medicare in 1983, hospitals are paid a set price for each Medicare patient treated, rather than being reimbursed for the patient's costs as had been done previously. An increasing number of other insurers have adopted a similar method of hospital payment. In these systems, the price, which depends on the patient's Diagnosis Related Group (DRG), is derived from the average cost over all hospitals of all patients in that DRG. We propose an alternative method for setting prices in hospital prospective payment systems, called equilibrium pricing, in which prices are derived from a linear programming model of competitive equilibrium. To evaluate the improvement in incentives associated with equilibrium pricing, we define a measure, called the disincentive index, of the extent to which a set of prices creates economic disincentives to efficient behavior. In the situation in which all hospitals compete in a single market area, we show that equilibrium pricing creates the best possible economic incentives, i.e., by reducing the disincentive index to zero. The analysis is then extended to the more realistic situation where hospitals compete in limited geographical market areas, whereas prices must be uniformly set for a number of such market areas. We prove that, with an appropriate generalization of the disincentive index, equilibrium prices for a single market area are also optimal for multiple market areas. Finally, actual cost and utilization data from hospitals that compete in eastern Massachusetts are used to determine prices and to evaluate the associated disincentive index for a simulated prospective payment system. This empirical study shows a dramatic improvement in the incentives created by equilibrium pricing compared to average-cost pricing.

A simple approach is introduced for solving linearly constrained partial equilibrium models based on an iterative scheme similar to the simplex method. It allows large-scale models to be solved, within a practical tolerance, efficiently even in a micro computer environment. Extensions to linearly constrained convex optimization problems are presented. Finally, a set of computational tests on 68 linear programs from the NETLIB library is reported. Comparison of our approach with the simplex method (using MINOS 5.1) and with Karmarkar's algorithm is reported. For moderate precision requirements these preliminary results are highly encouraging.

J	ROBINS, RP; SCHACHTER, B				ROBINS, RP; SCHACHTER, B			AN ANALYSIS OF THE RISK IN DISCRETELY REBALANCED OPTION HEDGES AND DELTA-BASED TECHNIQUES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						HEDGE; OPTION; DELTA; DISCRETE REBALANCING	HEDGING OPTIONS; RETURN	The stochastic properties of discretely rebalanced option hedges have been studied extensively beginning with Black and Scholes (1973). In each analysis hedges were ''delta-neutral'' after rebalancing. We argue that the distributional properties of discretely rebalanced hedges are such that delta-based hedging is not the variance minimizing strategy. This paper obtains analytical expressions for the variance minimizing option hedge ratios. We also evaluate the hedge variance to assess the magnitude of the variance reduction over delta-based hedges. For representative parameter values, we show that systematic departures from delta-based hedges can yield significant reductions in hedge variance even for one day rebalancing intervals.

Drawing on theoretical and empirical research on transaction costs, we develop and test a model of the determinants of the degree of electronic integration in the commercial segment of the property and casualty (P&C) industry. Based on a sample of 120 independent agencies operating under dedicated information technology-mediated conditions, we provide empirical support for three hypotheses on the determinants of electronic integration. Implications and research extensions are identified to guide further research in this important area.

J	BALAKRISHNAN, A; MAGNANTI, TL; MIRCHANDANI, P				BALAKRISHNAN, A; MAGNANTI, TL; MIRCHANDANI, P			A DUAL-BASED ALGORITHM FOR MULTILEVEL NETWORK DESIGN	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						NETWORK DESIGN; INTEGER PROGRAMMING; DUAL ASCENT ALGORITHM	STEINER PROBLEM; GRAPHS	Given an undirected network with L possible facility types for each edge, and a partition of the nodes into L levels or grades, the Multi-level Network Design (MLND) problem seeks a fixed cost minimizing design that spans all the nodes and connects the nodes at each level by facilities of the corresponding or higher grade. This problem generalizes the well-known Steiner network problem and the hierarchical network design problem, and has applications in telecommunication, transportation, and electric power distribution network design. In a companion paper we studied alternative model formulations for a two-level version of this problem, and analyzed the worst-case performance of several heuristics based on Steiner network and spanning tree solutions. This paper develops a dual-based algorithm for the MLND problem. The method first performs problem preprocessing to fix certain design variables, and then applies a dual ascent procedure to generate upper and lower bounds on the optimal value. We report extensive computational results on large, random two-level test problems (containing up to 500 nodes, and 5,000 edges) with varying cost structures. The integer programming formulation of the largest of these problems has 20,000 integer variables and over 5 million constraints. Our tests indicate that the dual-based algorithm is very effective, producing solutions that are within 0.9% of optimality.

J	NAHMIAS, S; SMITH, SA				NAHMIAS, S; SMITH, SA			OPTIMIZING INVENTORY LEVELS IN A 2-ECHELON RETAILER SYSTEM WITH PARTIAL LOST SALES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTIECHELON INVENTORY SYSTEM; LOST SALES; RETAILING; NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION	STOCK ALLOCATION; POLICIES; APPROXIMATIONS; WAREHOUSE	This paper considers a retailer inventory system with N first-echelon stores and a single second-echelon distribution center (DC). Customer demands at the stores are assumed to be random. When a stockout occurs, customers are willing to wait for their order to be filled with a known probability. Customers who are unwilling to wait result in lost sales. The first and second echelons are both restocked at fixed, equally spaced time points, where the store restocking frequency is an integer multiple of the DC restocking frequency. We also assume that replenishment quantities at both echelons can be adjusted up to the time of delivery, resulting in replenishment lead times equal to zero. This simplification allows us to determine optimal solutions for the partial lost sales case, which has proven intractable for two-echelon formulations with lead times. Computational results are given for illustrative examples.		NAHMIAS, S (reprint author), SANTA CLARA UNIV,SANTA CLARA,CA 95053, USA.

This paper explores the amount of suboptimization in such a situation, using an actual demand data set provided by other researchers. We consider low-demand, high-cost items controlled on an (S - 1, S) basis, with all warehouse stockouts met on an emergency-ordering basis. We demonstrate that the suboptimality penalty for this data set is 3% to 5% when single-echelon systems are appropriately parameterized.

J	SONG, JS				SONG, JS			THE EFFECT OF LEADTIME UNCERTAINTY IN A SIMPLE STOCHASTIC INVENTORY MODEL	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INVENTORY; STOCHASTIC MODELS; STOCHASTIC COMPARISONS; TOTAL POSITIVITY	POLICIES; SYSTEMS; EOQ	We study a basic continuous-time single-item inventory model where demands form a compound Poisson process and leadtimes are stochastic. The performance measure of interest is the long-run average cost. Order costs are linear, so a base-stock policy is optimal. We focus on the behavior of the optimal base-stock level in response to stochastically larger or more variable leadtimes. We also investigate the behavior of the corresponding long-run average costs. We show that a stochastically larger leadtime requires a higher optimal base-stock level. However, a stochastically larger leadtime may not necessarily result in a higher optimal average cost, because sometimes the variability effects may dominate. On the other hand, a more variable leadtime always leads to a higher optimal average cost. The effect of leadtime variability on optimal policies depends on the inventory cost structure: A more variable leadtime requires a higher optimal base-stock level if and only if the unit penalty (holding) cost rate is high (low). Similar results regarding the effect of leadtime demand are also discussed. In this latter case, the compound Poisson assumption is not necessary.

Catastrophic consequences can be associated with faulty decision making in reliability-seeking organizations, a situation which does not occur in most organizations studied in the past. Observations are drawn from two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. We find decision processes which appear to change often in these organizations. Important decisions can be made by a number of men even at the lowest levels of the organization. Task-related factors such as technical complexity, high interdependence, and catastrophic consequences associated with rare events and more cognitive factors such as accountability and salience affect decision processes. A model is presented that accounts for dynamic change in decision processes in these organizations.

Since the carrying costs increase from stage to stage, the standard production procedure, that is, to determine a total leadtime for the entire order by taking an appropriate percentile of the distribution of total processing time and then release the order immediately from stage to stage during the process, may not be optimal since it ignores inventory carrying costs. This article studies a per stage planned leadtime dispatching policy for such systems. The order will not be released immediately to the next workstation prior to a predetermined delivery time, or planned leadtime. The vector of planned leadtimes at workstations is to be determined by trading off expected holding costs at all stages and expected penalty costs for exceeding the total planned leadtime. We show that the optimal vector of planned leadtimes may be obtained efficiently by solving an equivalent serial inventory model of the type considered in Clark and Scarf (1960).

This allows a study of market demand and firms' decisions on price, quality, technology and responsiveness in a competitive environment. When demand arises, a customer chooses the firm that maximizes its expected utility of price, quality and response time. The demand function for each firm is derived by analyzing a queueing system with competing servers. We then study price competition among firms with differentiated processing rates. In the equilibrium, the firm with a higher processing rate always enjoys a price premium, and, further, enjoys a larger market share when its opponent also has adequate processing rate to serve all the customers alone.

In this paper we model this problem as a nonlinear nondifferentiable optimization problem. A reformulation of the nonlinear optimization problem as a network flow problem is then developed. The formulation results in a network flow problem with side constraints. An additional, nonnetwork, variable measures the readiness level. This new formulation permits the use of network optimization tools in order to solve effectively very large problems. We then develop two numerical methods for solving this problem. One method is based on a heuristic that solves (approximately) the nondifferentiable problem. The second method is based on a Linear-Quadratic Penalty (LQP) algorithm, and it exploits the embedded network structure by placing the side constraints into the objective function. The resulting nonlinear network program is solved using a simplicial decomposition of the network constraint set. Numerical results indicate the viability of this approach on problems with up to 36,000 arcs and 17,000 nodes with 3,700 side constraints.

For concave nondecreasing utility functions this stochastic order preserves monotonicity between risk premium and the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion. We show that a stronger order, the Bickel-Lehmann notion of dispersion, preserves this monotonicity for the larger class of nondecreasing utilities.

MCSD rules also answer the question of whether all risk-averse individuals include a new asset in their portfolio when assets' returns are correlated. MCSD criteria are expressed in terms of the probability distributions of the assets and of the underlying portfolio. An empirical application of MCSD is provided using stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Often the information used in technical problem solving is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new location-is, in our terms, ''sticky.'' In this paper we explore the impact of information stickiness on the locus of innovation-related problem solving. We find, first, that when sticky information needed by problem solvers is held at one site only, problem solving will be carried out at that locus, other things being equal. Second, when more than one locus of sticky information is called upon by problem solvers, the locus of problem solving may iterate among these sites as problem solving proceeds. When the costs of such iteration are high, then, third, problems that draw upon multiple sites of sticky information will sometimes be ''task partitioned'' into subproblems that each draw on only one such locus, and / or, fourth, investments will be made to reduce the stickiness of information at some locations. Information stickiness appears to affect a number of issues of importance to researchers and practitioners. Among these are patterns in the diffusion of information, the specialization of firms, the locus of innovation, and the nature of problems selected by problem solvers.

This paper proposes user involvement as an intervening variable between user participation and system use. Embedding the constructs of participation and involvement into the theoretical framework of Fishbein and Ajzen, a model is developed and tested in a field study of information system projects. Several key findings emerge from the study. User participation and user involvement represent two distinct constructs, with participation leading to involvement, and involvement mediating the relationship between participation and system use. The critical dimension of user participation is overall responsibility. The role of user participation and involvement is different, depending upon whether system use is mandatory or voluntary.

The loss of pooling synergy in this process can be significant, and this paper investigates the impact of several measures to overcome the adverse effects on flow time, work-in-process inventory and machine utilization. These can be alleviated to a certain extent through reductions in setup times and lot sizes that has been traditionally emphasized in group technology, but a more concerted effort is required. Analytical models are first utilized to investigate the extent to which these adverse effects can be overcome through (1) reduction in setup time, (2) lot sizing, (3) reduction in the variability of process-times and job arrivals, and, (4) reduction in processing times through productivity improvements, all arising from part family-oriented processing. These insights are verified through a simulation comparison of five cellular manufacturing systems with a functional layout system in which optimal lot sizes, low move times and a part family-oriented scheduling rule are used.

Conditions are provided under which commitment to a long-term contract involving N rounds of investment improves upon repetition of N identical single-period contracts. Further, when the agent's reservation wage is sufficiently low the optimal contract is always long term. Keeping records of a manager's history of reporting activity facilitates contracting, since optimal contracts may require a link between past reports and future investments over a duration of two or more periods.

Using data on joint venture adoption from one homogeneous industry (information technology) sector and employing both linear and nonlinear estimations, we test the explanatory power of the internal-influence model in comparison with a competing model of external-influence. Our empirical results support the internal-influence model in this sector with additional evidence for generalizability provided through a multisector sample of joint venture formation. In contrast, empirical results on the diffusion of M-form structure are more consistent with the external-influence model.

The performance of the Bayes-Stein method for forecasting these parameters for use in the Markowitz model (with and without short sales) was compared with that of seven other estimation methods, and three alternative portfolio selection techniques. This paper represents the first large scale empirical investigation of the usefulness of the Bayes-Stein approach using historical data. This data was drawn from the London Stock Exchange. In contrast to earlier studies, the relative performance of Bayes-Stein was mixed. While it produced reasonable estimates of the mean returns vector, there were superior methods, e.g., overall mean, for estimating the covariance matrix when short sales were permitted. When short sales were prohibited, actual portfolio performance was clearly improved, although there was little to choose between the various estimation methods.

J	TEISBERG, EO				TEISBERG, EO			AN OPTION VALUATION ANALYSIS OF INVESTMENT CHOICES BY A REGULATED FIRM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						UNCERTAIN REGULATION; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; REAL OPTION VALUATION; CAPITAL INVESTMENT; REGULATORY INCENTIVES		This paper analyzes a utility power plant construction project using an option pricing model of the value of the capital investment. It includes descriptive factors frequently ignored in the valuation of capital investments by regulated firms, including lead time, lumpy and sequential cost outlays, irreversibility of expenditures, and uncertainty about regulatory outcomes for completed projects. The analysis shows the value of shorter lead time technologies, the value of flexibility to delay or abandon construction, the incentive to delay construction under uncertain regulation, and how cost recovery policies, such as possible disallowance of Allow for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), create incentives to invest less, but to complete construction quickly. The analysis may also apply in unregulated contexts, where the value of a completed project is affected by taxation, the possibility of nationalization, or possible competitors' actions that create uncertain restrictions on potential profits.

The taxonomy was developed with standard methods of cluster analysis, and is based on the relative importance attached to eleven competitive capabilities defining the manufacturing task of 164 large American manufacturing business units. Three distinct clusters of manufacturing strategy groups were observed. Though there is an industry effect, all three manufacturing strategy types are observed in various industries. The two main dimensions along which the manufacturing strategy groups differ are the ability of the firms in them to differentiate themselves from competition with their products and services, and the scope of their product lines and markets. A general method for mapping manufacturing strategies on these dimensions is described. For each manufacturing group, the relationships between the competitive capabilities (which describe the manufacturing task), the business context (the business unit strategy), manufacturing activities (manufacturing strategy choices), and manufacturing performance measures are explored and compared.

In this paper, we describe a parallel replacement problem in which the economic interdependence among assets is caused by capital rationing. The research was motivated by the experience gained from a vehicle fleet replacement study where solutions to serial replacement problems could not be implemented since they violated management's budget plan. When firms use budgets to control their expenditures, competition for the limited funds creates interdependent problems. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a zero-one integer program and develop a branch-and-bound algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation methodology. A multiplier adjustment method is developed to solve one Lagrangian dual.

These uncertainties are in the form of unplanned machine maintenance, varying production yields and rework, among others. In planning for production, an adequate model must incorporate these uncertainties into the representation of the production process. This paper treats the aggregate planning problem for a single product with random demand and random capacity. In the single-period problem, random capacity does not affect the optimal policy but results in a unimodal, nonconvex cost function. In the multiple-period and infinite-horizon settings order-up-to policies that are dependent on the distribution of capacity are shown to be optimal in spite of a nonconvex cost. In the infinite-horizon setting an intuitive description of the situation leads to the notion of a class of extended myopic policies, requiring the consideration of review periods of uncertain length.

The need for simulation arises because the state space of such systems is typically huge, making numerical computation inefficient. Naive simulation is inefficient due to the rarity of the system failure events. Failure biasing is a useful importance sampling technique for the simulation of such systems. However, until now, this technique has been largely heuristic. We present a mathematical framework for the study of failure biasing. Using this framework we derive variance reduction results which explain the orders of magnitude of variance reduction obtained in practice. We show that in many cases the magnitude of the variance reduction is such that the relative errors of the estimates remain bounded as the failure rates of components tend to zero. We also prove that the failure biasing heuristic in its original form may not give bounded relative error for a large class of systems and that a modification of the heuristic works for the general case. The theoretical results in this paper agree with experiments on the subject which have been reported in a previous paper.

These marginal sources are required to augment the supply from an overloaded regional source. The model accounts for variable costs of supply, fixed investment costs, capacity constraints at the regional and local levels, and water quality requirements at the local sites. A Lagrangian relaxation reduces the model to a series of simple local problems, the solution of which provides an optimal sequence for developing the marginal groundwater sources while reducing the demands on the regional source. A heuristic and an exact procedure are also proposed to solve the problem for arbitrary levels of supply from the regional source. The exact procedure uses characteristics of the optimal solution to reduce the model to a series of knapsack-type problems.

This paper is a critical analysis of the models available to aid competitive bidding decision making-bidding strategy and auction design-in real transactions. After an introductory overview, this paper describes the contexts in which auctions arise, reviews the ''mainstream'' theory of single, isolated auctions and discusses the important work involved in enrichment of this theory. In doing so, it indicates results that have been obtained and the sort of changes in analytical approach that are needed to tackle other critical enrichments. The paper summarizes briefly what is known about the direct use of models by bidders and auction designers. A general theme of this paper is that enriched models are needed to bring bidding theory closer to direct applicability in decision making.

For portfolios composed of a single risky asset and a single riskless asset, Constantinides ( 1979) shows that the optimal investment policy is described in terms of a no transaction region, where the optimal policy is to refrain from trading if initial portfolio holdings lie within the region, and to transact to the nearest boundary of the region if portfolio holdings lie outside the region. Because the boundaries could not be derived analytically, we developed an efficient and tractable algorithm to obtain the boundaries, which are expressed as the ratio of the dollar holdings in stocks and bonds. We considered two cases: the same transaction costs for the two assets, and costs incurred on only the risky asset. We derived the optimal trading strategies and utility levels for a large set of realistic parameters. In particular, we show that the no transaction region narrows and converges rapidly to the infinite horizon limit as the time horizon increases.

We present a disaggregate negative binomial regression procedure for analysis of count data observed for a heterogeneous sample of cross-sections, possibly over some fixed time periods. This procedure simultaneously pools or groups cross-sections while estimating a separate negative binomial regression model for each group. An E-M algorithm is described within a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the group proportions, the group-specific regression coefficients, and the degree of overdispersion in event rates within each derived group. The proposed procedure is illustrated with count data entailing nonnegative integer counts of purchases (events) for a frequently bought consumer good.

Two types of repair are possible: preventive and corrective, where the latter is supposed to be more time consuming than the first. The system is controlled by a repair policy of control limit type: a preventive repair on the working unit is carried out as soon as the state of this unit exceeds a certain threshold unless the repair facility is occupied by the other unit, In this paper we derive explicit expressions for the Laplace transforms of the up- and down-periods of this system, which provide insight in the availability of the system and which can be used to obtain approximations for the interval availability distribution. An iterative numerical procedure is presented for the special case of generalized Erlangian distributed repair times.

However, quality is highly multidimensional. Traditionally, regulators have collected measures of quality on many separate dimensions, and compared performance on these dimensions to explicit pass-fail standards. They have lacked a method of combining complex patterns of substandard and superstandard performance on these many dimensions to arrive at an overall evaluation of the quality of service. To redress this problem, we first describe the information processing problems regulators encounter when they attempt to integrate this complex array of information intuitively, and the problems that arise when the link between service quality (as reflected in patterns of passed and failed standards) and regulatory incentives is not made explicit to utility management. We develop a bootstrapped method for formalizing each expert regulator's evaluation policy using hierarchical conjoint analysis, and apply this method to the evaluation of local telephone companies by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC). We show that experts within the FPSC, the regulated utilities, and a large telephone customer exhibit very high agreement about how the various dimensions of quality should be differentially weighted. We derive a consensus measure of overall quality, Q, and identify a score associated with meeting all standards exactly, Q*. Utilities can then be rewarded based upon whether or not they exceed Q*, rather than on the basis of how many standards are met. Compared with a pattern in which each standard is met exactly, there exist patterns of mixed substandard and superstandard performance on the individual dimensions of quality that are less costly to produce and higher in overall quality. We compare utility incentives when rewards are based upon Q to those under the current pass	ANJOY QSP,ANN ARBOR,MI 48108	LYNCH, JG (reprint author), UNIV FLORIDA,COLL BUSINESS ADM,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611, USA.

We term this ability a firm's absorptive capacity and argue that such a capability not only enables a firm to exploit new extramural knowledge, but to predict more accurately the nature of future technological advances. We develop a stylized model in which we focus exclusively on firms' decisions to invest in their absorptive capacities. We first examine a monopolist's investment decision, analyzing the path dependence of its investment and the effect of uncertainty. We then consider the effect of competition by modeling the impact of entry on an incumbent's investment behavior. Implications for management and public policy are then discussed.

This paper offers an empirical examination of this distinction using experimental methods. Utilizing a series of experimental treatments based on a simple, two player extensive form game of perfect information, we find strong evidence that apparently rational people are often unwilling to rely on the self-interested behavior of others, despite the observed near universality of maximizing play.

Psychological models attempt to accommodate the numerous violations of rationality axioms, including independence and transitivity. Meanwhile, normatively oriented decision analysts continue to insist on the applied usefulness of the subjective expected utility (SEU) model. As this gap has widened, two facts have remained largely unobserved. First, most people in real situations attempt to behave in accord with the most basic rationality principles, even though they are likely to fail in more complex situations. Second, the SEU model is likely to provide consistent and rational answers to decision problems within a given problem structure, but may not be invariant across structures. Thus, people may be more rational than the psychological literature gives them credit for, and applications of the SEU model may be susceptible to some violations of invariance principles. This paper attempts to search out the common ground between the normative, descriptive, and prescriptive modeling by exploring three types of axioms concerning structural rationality, preference rationality, and quasi-rationality. Normatively the first two are mandatory and the last, suspect. Descriptively, all have been questioned, but often the inferences involved have confounded preference and structural rationality. We propose a prescriptive view thal entails full compliance with preference rationality, modifications of structural rationality, and acceptance of quasi-rationality to the extent of granting a primary role to the status quo and the decomposition of decision problems into gains and losses.

This note considers a multiple-shift workforce scheduling scenario for seven-days-a-week operations under a workweek arrangement called the 3-4 workweek. Our model seeks to minimize the workforce size subject to satisfying staffing requirements and workrules relating to off-days, off-weekends, and work-stretches. We provide an efficient optimal algorithm which is intuitive and simple enough to be implemented by hand.

J	HOFSTEDE, G				HOFSTEDE, G			MANAGEMENT SCIENTISTS ARE HUMAN	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CULTURE; UNCERTAINTY; POWER; INDIVIDUALISM		The culture of the national environment in which an organization operates affects the management process through the collective mental programming of its members, its managers, and the management scientists who offer their theories. Four dimensions of national culture differences have been found. Among other things, they affect the implicit models in people's minds of what the act of organizing means. Among the pioneers in management science around 1900, differences along these dimensions are already noticeable. A fifth dimension was added when the research instrument used was designed exclusively by Chinese scholars, and it provides a cultural explanation for the economic success of East Asian countries in the past quarter century. At the same time, it highlights the influence of the culture of the management scientist on the research questions and the resulting theories.

The logical nature of the components and of the connections between them are identified and analyzed. These connections are used as a basis for the argument that there is a meaningful concept of the fit between the components of the organization structure and those of its cultural setting. This concept of fit is defined and the values it may logically take are identified. A theory on the goodness and badness of fit between structure components and culture components is discussed and two of its many pieces are developed in detail.

J	LACHMAN, R; NEDD, A; HININGS, B				LACHMAN, R; NEDD, A; HININGS, B			ANALYZING CROSS-NATIONAL MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONS - A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CONTINGENCY THEORY; CULTURE; RESOURCE; AVAILABILITY; ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HONG-KONG; PERSPECTIVE; SOCIALIZATION; ENVIRONMENTS; CONTEXT; NORMS	The differential social control embedded in core and periphery values indigenous to a cultural setting, and the availability of resources in that setting, are discussed as critical factors for the effective adaptation of organizations and management practices transferred across cultural boundaries. The relationships between these factors and organizational structure, processes, and behavior, are analyzed and specified in a theoretical framework. The framework postulates the importance of congruent or, at least, accommodative relationships between the core values dominating the local setting, and those underlying transferred practices for the effectiveness of ''imported'' organizational practices. Four main contingencies of local-imported values' incongruence are described, and their implications for ''entry'' and ''coping'' strategies of cross-national organizations are discussed. The framework also offers a scheme for generating hypotheses regarding the effects of values on structures and behavior in cross-national organizations. The theoretical and managerial implications of the scheme are discussed and illustrated.

The analysis suggests that the theories vary in their degree of applicability to the Chinese context. While some theories, such as population ecology, seem to be clearly inapplicable, others, such as the equity theory of motivation, are more suitable, though they all require significant adjustment before they can be used to study and interpret the structure and processes of Chinese enterprises, and the attitudes and behavior of those employed in them. Making the adjustment, however, is likely to lead to positive developments in organizational theory.

Both theoretical and measurement issues are considered using structural equations and partial least squares as the primary data analysis approaches. The results regarding the universality question are equivocal-findings varied across cultural groups in most cases. However, the theoretical model still appears to be a useful tool for understanding how business negotiations vary across cultural groups.

Our study is based on data collected from 164 senior managers working in 14 different national subsidiaries within the consumer electronics division of Matsushita, a Japanese company, and 84 senior managers working in nine different national subsidiaries within the same business of N.V. Philips, the Holland-based competitor of Matsushita. We show that while subsidiary autonomy has no discernable influence on interunit communication, interpersonal relationships developed through lateral networking mechanisms such as joint work in teams, taskforces, and meetings have significant positive effects on the frequency of both subsidiary-headquarters and intersubsidiary communication. The findings are consistent in the two companies, one Japanese and the other European, and the underlying theoretical propositions appear applicable across borders.

J	FARLEY, JU; LEHMANN, DR				FARLEY, JU; LEHMANN, DR			CROSS-NATIONAL LAWS AND DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RESPONSE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING; METAANALYSIS; INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES	UNITED-STATES; META-ANALYSIS; DIFFUSION; PATTERNS; DETERMINANTS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; COUNTRIES; DEMAND; MODELS	International differences in general, and cultural differences in particular, exert profound influence on what people buy. In modeling market response, highly visible international differences in purchase behavior seem to lead to an assumption by management scientists that there are large parallel international differences in market response to such things as price and advertising. In an interpretive review of market response models, we do find international differences in response parameters, but we also find that parameter differences due to cross-national factors tend to be smaller than differences related to technical characteristics of the model or to product/market specifics. We suggest two new intermediate categories of generalizability between the extremes of ''everything is the same'' and ''everything is different.'' We also argue that one promising approach to international generalization is through appropriate statistical adjustment of parameters from existing models.

The value of this network derives from the opportunity to benefit from uncertainty through the coordination of subsidiaries which are geographically dispersed. We model this coordination as the operating flexibility to shift production between two manufacturing plants located in different countries. A stochastic dynamic programming model treats explicitly this flexibility as equivalent to owning an option, the value of which is dependent upon the real exchange rate. The model is extended to analyze hysteresis effects and within-country growth options.

J	EUN, CS; RESNICK, BG				EUN, CS; RESNICK, BG			INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS UNITED-STATES AND JAPANESE PERSPECTIVES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION; USA; JAPAN	EXCHANGE-RATE; PRICES; RISK	In this paper, we analyze the gains from international diversification of investment portfolios from the Japanese as well as the U.S. perspectives. The major findings of this paper include: First, the 'potential' gains from international, as opposed to purely domestic, diversification are much greater for U.S. investors than for Japanese investors. For U.S. investors, the gains accrue not so much in terms of lower risk as in terms of higher return, and the opposite holds for Japanese investors. Second, using various 'ex ante' international investment strategies designed to control parameter uncertainty, U.S. investors can realize substantial gains from international diversification in out-of-sample periods. Japanese investors, however, can gain relatively little. Third, hedging exchange risk generally allows the U.S., but not Japanese, investors to benefit more from international diversification. For U.S. investors, the international bond diversification with exchange risk hedging offers a superior risk-return trade-off than the international stock diversification, with or without hedging.

J	CHENG, JLC				CHENG, JLC			ON THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL SCIENCE - IMPLICATIONS FOR CROSS-NATIONAL RESEARCH	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CROSS-CULTURE RESEARCH; ORGANIZATION STUDIES	CULTURE	This paper argues that the present conception of universal knowledge as generalized findings is incomplete and has limited the role of cross-national research to one of validating results obtained from single-nation studies. An alternative view is proposed which recognizes that there are two types of research findings that can be applied cross-nationally: (1) findings that are invariant across different national settings, and (2) findings that incorporate the societal context into the analysis of the phenomenon under study. This conception of universal knowledge is more inclusive in scope and suggests an expanded role for cross-national research in organizational inquiry. The new role will offer exciting opportunities for the field of organizational science, including its enhanced ability to discover knowledge that has both universal applicability and global relevance.

J	PAICH, M; STERMAN, JD				PAICH, M; STERMAN, JD			BOOM, BUST, AND FAILURES TO LEARN IN EXPERIMENTAL MARKETS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION MAKING; SIMULATION; FEEDBACK; EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS; SYSTEM DYNAMICS	BEHAVIORAL SIMULATION-MODELS; DYNAMIC DECISION-MAKING; DIFFUSION; FEEDBACK; TECHNOLOGIES; EDUCATION; BIASES; TIME	Boom and bust is a pervasive dynamic for new products- Word of mouth, marketing, and learning curve effects can fuel rapid growth, often leading to overcapacity, price war, and bankruptcy. Previous experiments suggest such dysfunctional behavior can be caused by systematic ''misperceptions of feedback,'' where decision makers do not adequately account for critical feedbacks, time delays, and nonlinearities which condition system dynamics. However, prior studies often failed to vary the strength of these feedbacks as treatments, omitted market processes, and failed to allow for learning. A decision making task portraying new product dynamics is used to test the theory by varying the strength of kev feedback processes in a simulated market. Subjects performed the task repeatedly, encouraging learning. Nevertheless, performance relative to potential is poor and is severely degraded when the feedback complexity of the environment is high, supporting the misperception of feedback hypothesis. The negative effects of feedback complexity on performance were not moderated by experience, even though average performance improved. Models of the subjects' decision making heuristics are estimated; changes over trials in estimated cue weights explain why subjects improve on average but fail to gain insight into the dynamics of the system. Though conditions for learning are excellent, experience does not appear to mitigate the misperceptions of feedback or systematic dysfunction they cause in dynamic decision making tasks. We discuss implications for educational use of simulations and games.

J	JOHNSON, ME; BRANDEAU, ML				JOHNSON, ME; BRANDEAU, ML			AN ANALYTIC MODEL FOR DESIGN OF A MULTIVEHICLE AUTOMATED GUIDED VEHICLE SYSTEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MANUFACTURING; AUTOMATED SYSTEMS; TRANSPORTATION; NETWORK MODELS	AGV SYSTEMS; PATH	We consider the problem of designing a multivehicle automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) to supplement an existing nonautomated material handling system. The AGVS consists of a pool of vehicles that deliver raw components from a central storage area to workcenters throughout the factor floor. The objective is to determine which workcenters warrant automated component delivery and the number of vehicles required to service those workcenters, to maximize the benefit of the AGVS, subject to a constraint that the average waiting time for material transport in the system not exceed a predefined limit, The pool of vehicles is modeled as an M/G/c queuing system and the design model is formulated as a binary integer program with nonlinear waiting time constraints, which are expressed by approximate queueing formula. We develop two different implicit enumeration algorithms to exactly solve the analytical model. We illustrate our model with an example of an actual AGVS design problem at Hewlett-Packard, and we present computational experience for other example design problems. We show how sensitivity analysis can be used to ensure that the analytical model yields an optimal solution to the design problem.

Various assumptions for this model include i.i.d. demand, linear ordering, holding and penalty costs. Goods have a known fixed lifetime and perished goods cause a linear outdating cost to be incurred. The approach we use, that of developing heuristics from 'near myopic' bounds, involves viewing periodic inventory problems in the framework of the classic ''newsboy'' model. We exploit various properties of the problem under consideration to derive tight bounds on the newsboy parameters, thus leading to efficient bounds on the order quantities. Computational studies reveal that the heuristic policies are near optimal, and are easy to compute.

J	GALLEGO, G; YAO, DD; MOON, I				GALLEGO, G; YAO, DD; MOON, I			OPTIMAL-CONTROL OF A MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT INVOLVES TRIAL RUNS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							STOCHASTIC CONVEXITY	We study a manufacturing process that is quite common in semiconductor wafer fabrication. In generic terms, the job to be processed consists of J units. To process the job, a ''setup'' is required, followed by routine processing and testing. In principle, the entirety of the job can be set up and processed in a single batch. However, the setup is prone to failure, leading to loss of units. Hence, in practice trial runs are often conducted, with each trial involving a small batch of units. Here we identify an optimal control of such processes. The policy prescribes a maximum of k* (less-than-or-equal-to J) single-unit trial runs. To establish optimality, we use the recently developed notion of stochastic convexity/concavity and related machinery.

J	GRABOWSKI, M; WALLACE, WA				GRABOWSKI, M; WALLACE, WA			AN EXPERT-SYSTEM FOR MARITIME PILOTS - ITS DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT USING GAMING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION AIDS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; MARITIME INDUSTRY	PERFORMANCE	Increased maritime traffic, new types of vessels, and construction of oil and gas producing structures have made navigating in close waters more hazardous. In addition, attempts to increase shipboard productivity have resulted in fewer personnel on board the vessel. This paper reports on the development and evaluation of a prototype expert system to support the cognitive processes involved in piloting: maneuvering and collision avoidance, and the practice of good seamanship. A model was constructed and implemented in a frame- and rule-based representation. The system was assessed using gaming with novice pilots in a merchant marine training facility. The results showed significant improvement in the bridge watch team performance, but no significant improvement in vessel performance in terms of trackkeeping. The paper concludes with a discussion of the motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills needed for piloting and how they could be supported by expert system technology as part of an integrated bridge system, an operational center for navigational and supervisory tasks aboard a ship.

This paper provides evidence on the time pattern of lottery participation to see whether actual behavior is consistent with this fallacy. Using data from the Maryland daily numbers game, we find a clear and consistent tendency for the amount of money bet on a particular number to fall sharply immediately after it is drawn, and then gradually to recover to its former level over the course of several months. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that lottery players are in fact subject to the gambler's fallacy.

The probabilities from each of four types of physicians are evaluated on an overall basis and in terms of specific attributes, and the groups are compared. The physicians with the most experience and expertise perform better overall. All four groups appear to be reasonably well calibrated, and the key factor in relative overall performance is the level of discrimination provided by the probabilities. Averages of two, three, and four probabilities for each individual patient are also analyzed. As the number of the probabilities in the average increases, performance improves on average on all dimensions, although the best overall performance is exhibited by a combination of probabilities from the two physician types performing best individually. Some comparisons are made with previous work, and implications for probability assessment and combination in medicine and more generally in other areas of application are discussed. Important characteristics of the study are the fact that it was conducted on-line in a real setting, the involvement of individuals with different levels of expertise, the use of a true predictive situation with a clearly-defined event, the consideration of multiple dimensions of the quality of judgments, and the collection of multiple probabilities for each case to permit the investigation of a variety of possible combinations of probabilities.

J	GUTMAN, E; YAGIL, J				GUTMAN, E; YAGIL, J			A PRACTICAL DERIVED LEASE RATE ALGORITHM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTIPLE-INVESTMENT-SINKING FUND (MISF) METHOD; LEASING; DISCOUNT RATE; MACLAURIN SERIES		Underlying the widely used multiple-investment-sinking fund (MISF) method for lease evaluation is the determination of a derived lease rate which is a specific rate that provides the lessor with the required yield on equity. To compute this derived lease rate, trial-and-error techniques are traditionally used. In addition to being based on trial-and-error, the employment of these techniques requires a specification of the precise time structure of the various types of cash flows involved, and this can be somewhat technically cumbersome. To overcome these shortcomings, this study presents a mathematical derivation of a formal expression for the derived lease rate. Due to the widespread use of the MISF method, it seems that the formal expression developed here can be very useful for decision makers (at both the corporate as well as the individual-investor levels) in determining the derived lease rate in practice. Another desirable property of the model is that it can be easily employed for the purpose of studying the effects of changes in the various parameters involved on the derived lease rate.

In their paper, it was claimed that (under the assumption that there is no upper limit on the investment in an asset) the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio is at most 2T + 2, where T is the number of time periods in the data base used to approximate the parameters of the return distributions of the assets. The formulation we present, which is shown to be equivalent to that of Konno and Yamazaki, has a bound of T + 2 on the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio.

We use a model in which contracts between the firm and managers are incomplete so that providing incentives to subordinates is not straightforward. Leadership style, whether based on organizational culture or on the personality of the leader, then affects the incentive contracts that can be offered to subordinates. We show that leaders who empathize with their employees adopt a participatory style and that shareholders gain from appointing such leaders when the firm has the potential for exploiting numerous innovative ideas. By contrast, when the environment is poor in new ideas, shareholders benefit from hiring a more selfish (i.e., more profit maximizing) leader whose style is more autocratic.

J	BAYUS, BL				BAYUS, BL			HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION - ASSESSING DEMAND FORECASTS FOR A NEXT-GENERATION CONSUMER DURABLE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TECHNOLOGY POLICY; CONSUMER ELECTRONICS; MARKETING; MANUFACTURING	DIFFUSION-MODELS; PRICE	High-Definition Television promises to be the next generation of television. This technology has broad implications for consumer markets, as well as the underlying manufacturing, technology development, and R&D activities of firms. Under increasing pressure from various groups, the U.S. government must make major policy and funding decisions based on its assessment of the likely demand for HDTV. Three published reports which forecast sales of HDTV after its scheduled introduction in the mid-1990s are available. Unfortunately, these forecasts offer widely differing perspectives on HDTV's potential. This paper presents an approach that links product segmentation (based on historical demand parameters, and marketing and manufacturing related variables) and demand forecasting for new products. The published HDTV forecasts are then assessed using this segmentation scheme. Differing from the Congressional Budget Office's earlier evaluation, this analysis indicates that one report is consistent with historical data from the home appliance industry.

Rather than assume (as in the entropy, Herfindahl and concentric indices of diversification) that the levels of synergy generated by different related combinations of business units are identical, we estimate synergy directly using a modified version of the concentric index. In addition to estimating synergy using capital market performance of the firm as a whole, we examine the effects of nondrug diversification on the innovative productivity of firms' pharmaceutical divisions alone. Our two main findings are that production relatedness, such as that between drugs and chemicals, in fact did not imply synergy over the period of our study; and that the patterns of synergy for different types of relatedness shifted over time with the industry life cycle.

The analytical intractibility of such systems makes simulation and heuristics essential in studying them. In this paper we develop some theoretical results-reversibility and dominance-that characterize the dynamics of these systems, provide insight into their behavior and help greatly reduce the simulation effort needed to study them. These structural results also provide the basis for developing heuristics to deal effectively with particular cases. Reversibility deals with certain permutations of the machines; dominance deals with the allocation of kanbans to cells. In addition, we show that if our goal is to maximize the throughput with a given total fixed number of cards, all of the machines should be placed in a single cell. These structural results hold in general because no assumptions are made on the processing time distribution of the machines, the number of cells, the total number of kanbans, or whether or not the machines are identical. Based on the structural results, we also develop a heuristic for the allocation of kanbans to a balanced line. We briefly describe an implementation of this model at a laminate manufacturing plant.

The purpose of the study is to identify those assumptions and parameters which lead to the most efficient use of preference judgements made by the decision maker, and to the greatest robustness to judgmental errors. It is concluded that nonlinearities in the value function need to be modelled, achieved here by use of a piecewise linear form. It was also found that search for indifference points, rather than using simple preference judgements alone, is of great advantage, best realized by expressing judgements in terms of pairwise trade-offs. Methods incorporating these features are highly robust to judgmental errors. Interactive methods of this class are compared with a priori fitting of similar value functions, and found to give a very similar quality of solution.

J	DELQUIE, P				DELQUIE, P			INCONSISTENT TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN ATTRIBUTES - NEW EVIDENCE IN PREFERENCE ASSESSMENT BIASES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; UTILITY THEORY; PREFERENCE MODELS; HEURISTICS AND BIASES	REVERSAL PHENOMENON; UTILITY-ASSESSMENT; CHOICE	One of the fundamental postulates of rational choice is that preferences manifested by an individual towards alternatives should only depend on the merits of these alternatives and not on extraneous, irrelevant factors. Violations of this basic principle, so-called preference reversals, have puzzled researchers for over twenty years and raised concerns about the use of preference modeling in decision analysis. The present work seeks to further determine the nature of these phenomena, in particular the role played by response mode in certain types of preference reversals. Hershey and Schoemaker (1985) found Probability and Certainty Equivalents to differ systematically and attributed this difference to a framing effect. Here, we generalize their experimental design to control for framing effects and study biases on a larger scope. Our results show that biases do not disappear in the absence of framing, instead they reveal a clear and pervasive bias occurring under more controlled experimental conditions than previously known: direct trade-offs between two attributes X and Y are biased depending on whether X is traded off against Y, or Y traded off against X. From among several hypotheses, the data lend support to the general principle of compatibility (Tversky et al. 1988; Slovic et al. 1990), which implies that an attribute receives more relative weight when it is used as ''currency'' in trading off.

J	GOLEC, JH				GOLEC, JH			THE EFFECTS OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTRACTS ON THE RISK AND RETURN PERFORMANCE OF COMMODITY TRADING ADVISERS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTRACTS; COMMODITY TRADING ADVISERS; AGENCY THEORY; COMMODITY FUND PERFORMANCE; OPTIONS	INVESTMENT; SELECTION; MARKETS; FUNDS	This paper shows that commodity trading advisors' (CTAs) investment performance may be partially explained by their incentive compensation contracts. Contracts include base, incentive and asset parameters. The relationships between contract parameters and performance are theoretically indeterminate but are examined here empirically. Results indicate that incentive parameters are positively related to return means and standard deviations. The dollar amounts of assets CTAs manage are negatively related to return means and standard deviations, supporting Elton et al.'s (1987, 1989) finding that CTA performance falls after public offerings of commodity funds. Intuitively, since dollar fees are a function of assets, at the higher asset and fee levels achieved through commodity fund offerings, CTAs may safeguard assets and fees by pursuing less risky investment strategies.

Shareholders can acquire costly information about the manager's effort to produce output. Concentrating share ownership leads the largest shareholder to (i) acquire more precise signals of effort and (ii) modify the compensation contract. Better monitoring increases output, and hence firm value. However, the (risk averse) large shareholder bears more idiosyncratic firm risk as his stake in the firm increases. These forces equilibrate at a unique welfare maximizing ownership structure. Under a strong condition on the purchase or sale of shares by large stockholders, investors have incentives to trade toward the ownership structure that maximizes the social surplus. When all investors are price takers only a diffuse ownership structure can arise in a competitive equilibrium.		HUDDART, S (reprint author), STANFORD UNIV,GRAD SCH BUSINESS,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.

J	HILLER, RS; ECKSTEIN, J				HILLER, RS; ECKSTEIN, J			STOCHASTIC DEDICATION - DESIGNING FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIOS USING MASSIVELY-PARALLEL BENDERS DECOMPOSITION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FINANCE; PORTFOLIOS; STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING; BENDERS DECOMPOSITION; COMPUTERS PARALLEL; DECISION ANALYSIS; RISK	TERM STRUCTURE; PROGRAMS	Drawing on recent developments in discrete time fixed income options theory, we propose a stochastic programming procedure, which we call stochastic dedication, for managing asset/liability portfolios with interest rate contingent claims. The model uses scenario generation to combine deterministic dedication techniques with stochastic duration matching methods, and provides the portfolio manager with a risk/return Pareto optimal frontier from which a portfolio may be selected based on individual risk attitudes. We employ a fixed income risk metric that can be interpreted as the fair market value of a collection of interest rate options that eliminates bankruptcy risk from the asset/liability portfolio. We incorporate this metric into a risk/return stochastic optimization model, using a binomial lattice sampling procedure to construct interest rate paths and cash flow streams from an arbitrage-free term structure model. The resulting parametric linear program has a particularly simple subproblem structure, and we have been able to solve it using resource-directed decomposition on a massively parallel computer system, the Connection Machine CM-2. We take a novel approach that uses a standard serial simplex method to solve the master problem, but generates scenarios and Benders cuts in a massively parallel manner. We discuss the performance of this implementation and present the results for a simple pension fund immunization problem.

J	TVERSKY, A; SIMONSON, I				TVERSKY, A; SIMONSON, I			CONTEXT-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION MAKING; CONSUMER CHOICE; INDEPENDENCE OF IRRELEVANT ALTERNATIVES	CHOICE; ATTRACTION; MODELS	The standard theory of choice-based on value maximization-associates with each option a real value such that, given an offered set, the decision maker chooses the option with the highest value. Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the ''market share'' of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent preferences.

J	HENDRICKS, KB; MCCLAIN, JO				HENDRICKS, KB; MCCLAIN, JO			THE OUTPUT PROCESSES OF SERIAL PRODUCTION LINES OF GENERAL MACHINES WITH FINITE BUFFERS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SERIAL PRODUCTION LINES; OUTPUT PROCESSES; CORRELATION STRUCTURE; OUTPUT VARIABILITY	COVARIANCE STRUCTURE; DEPARTURE PROCESS; RENEWAL PROCESS; POINT PROCESS; QUEUES; WORK	Little is known about the interaction among manufacturing subsystems in a factory. The output of one manufacturing subsystem is usually the input to one or more others in the plant. For example, a production line may provide input to another manufacturing stage, a shipping system, or an automated parts conveyor. In all of these examples, the characteristics of the output from the production line can affect the subsequent process. This paper examines the output process of a serial production line of N machines with general processing time distributions and finite buffer capacities. Simulation is used to examine the effects of line length, buffer capacity, and buffer placement on the inter-departure distribution and correlation structure (autocorrelation function) of the output process of the production line. Results from this analysis are useful in setting production line design parameters and in determining the extent to which buffer placement can be used to control the variability of the output process, and thereby the amount of work-in-process present in downstream subsystems. Additional insights are provided to help explain why small buffers in production lines are normally adequate and to help us better understand the effects of buffers on tightly coupled production systems. By using a variety of processing time distributions, previously unknown effects attributed to skew of processing time are revealed. Since skew can often be reduced or eliminated by operator training, these effects are of particular interest since they can help to quantify some of the benefits of training.

Such contracts are of importance to traders who periodically transact in spot markets and who require protection from adverse moves in their total accrued costs realized over their trading horizons. Explicit valuation models for pricing a variety of path dependent contracts based on geometric and arithmetic averages are developed. The early exercise features of American contracts are investigated, and it is shown that this feature has significant value.

Phantoms can both help and hinder successful decision making. On the one hand, phantoms can provide useful information on the boundaries of a decision problem and thus help generate new options through a restructuring of the problem. But phantoms can also produce biases, deception, and suboptimal decisions. We argue that phantoms should be considered explicitly in decision structuring rather than being allowed to work their effects surreptitiously. We offer guidelines on recognizing unavailable alternatives, utilizing the information provided by phantoms, counteracting phantom biases, avoiding deception in decision structuring, and guarding against suboptimal decisions.

J	GABA, A				GABA, A			INFERENCES WITH AN UNKNOWN NOISE-LEVEL IN A BERNOULLI PROCESS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DICHOTOMOUS DATA; NOISE; BAYESIAN INFERENCE	MODEL	Inferences about a proportion p are often based on data generated from dichotomous processes, which are generally modeled as processes that are Bernoulli in p. In reality, the assumption that a data-generating process is Bernoulli in p is often violated due to the presence of noise. The level of noise is usually unknown and, furthermore, dependent on the unknown proportion in which one is interested. A specific model which takes into account the existence of noise is developed. Any arguments about p based exclusively on a likelihood analysis can lead to difficulties. A Bayesian approach is used, which also helps us to formalize a priori dependence between the proportion and the noise level. Empirical data are used to illustrate the model and provide some flavor of the implications of our uncertainty about the noise for inferences about a proportion.

The approximation is based on the conservation law, and on assumptions which might be acceptable if N much greater than c. The authors' approximation formula is numerically examined for various phase-type GI/GI/c(N) queues and the results show that the approximation is very good for practical parameter settings. The authors' approximation stands merely on a stationarity assumption. Therefore, it is also expected to be good for G/G/c(N) queues with a large N.

J	KAO, EPC; SMITH, MS				KAO, EPC; SMITH, MS			DISCOUNTED AND PER UNIT NET REVENUES AND COSTS OF PRODUCT WARRANTY - THE CASE OF PHASE-TYPE LIFETIMES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCT WARRANTY; COST AND REVENUE ANALYSIS; PHASE-TYPE LIFETIMES	RENEWAL	In a paper published in this journal, Mamer (1987) studies the expected costs to producers and benefits to consumers of three types of product warranty: the ordinary free replacement warranty, the unlimited free replacement warranty, and the pro-rata warranty. In addition to assuming a random product lifetime, Mamer's models allow for randomness in consumer repurchase behavior and for the possibility of an independent damage process acting on products sold under warranty. The criteria for evaluating warranty policies are discounted costs and net revenues over an infinite horizon, and per unit costs and net revenues. In this paper, we consider the case of phase-type product lifetimes. Under this assumption, we simplify the computation of the expected cost and revenue functions. Since most distributions can often be represented by phase-type distributions, our simplifications enhance the applicability of Mamer's useful yet computationally unwieldy results. For the per-unit-net-revenue criterion, our results supplement those of Mamer's. There, we also establish an interesting relation pertaining to expected net revenues as a function of consumer loyalty. We find that under the per-unit-net-revenue criterion, from the producer's perspective, repeated purchases by the same customer are not as profitable as one would intuitively conjecture. Such a counter-intuitive relation makes the need for being able to compute various cost and revenue functions more compelling-particularly when lifetimes are not exponential.

The Combined procedure is sensible because the Tchebycheff and Aspiration Criterion Vector methods possess complementary distinguishing characteristics, solve similar optimization problems to probe the nondominated set, and share a similar computer / user interface. In the early iterations, Tchebycheff probes of the nondominated set might be conducted to locate promising neighborhoods of search. In later iterations, Aspiration Criterion Vector probes might be used to pinpoint a final solution. Computational experience is reported showing the improved effectiveness of the Combined Procedure when employed in this fashion when compared against the Tchebycheff and Aspiration Criterion Vector methods run separately.

DEA estimators of the best practice monotone increasing and concave production function are shown to be also maximum likelihood estimators if the deviation of actual output from the efficient output is regarded as a stochastic variable with a monotone decreasing probability density function. While the best practice frontier estimator is biased below the theoretical frontier for a finite sample size, the bias approaches zero for large samples. The DEA estimators exhibit the desirable asymptotic property of consistency, and the asymptotic distribution of the DEA estimators of inefficiency deviations is identical to the true distribution of these deviations.

This study examined the influence of a set four antecedent constructs (superordinate goals, accessibility, physical proximity and formalized rules and procedures) on the attainment of both cross-functional cooperation and perceived project outcomes. Through the use of path analysis, the results indicated that superordinate goals, physical proximity and project team rules and procedures have significant direct and/or indirect effects on project outcomes through influencing cross-functional cooperation. Further, cross-functional cooperation was a significant predictor of both perceived task and psychosocial project outcomes. Directions for management practice and future research are discussed.

The fixed costs of capacity acquisitions are often included in these prices. We examine the interaction between capacity acquisition and competition when capacity is available in fixed increments. We find predictably that if the increments are small, unit capacity cost is a good approximation for the internal price, and if the increments are large, the internal price is zero. However, the relationship between the internal price and the capacity increment for intermediate cases is quite irregular, to the extent that it is not possible to approximate the internal price with accounting data. The analysis also suggests that full cost allocation overcharges for the opportunity cost of capacity. Furthermore, the right internal price does not act either as a way of recovering fixed costs or as a proxy for externalities such as congestion costs. The conclusions are not materially altered in the case where variable costs increase at the margin, and where these costs rather than hard capacity constraints are the reason to restrict output.

J	HENNART, JF; PARK, YR				HENNART, JF; PARK, YR			GREENFIELD VS ACQUISITION - THE STRATEGY OF JAPANESE INVESTORS IN THE UNITED-STATES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						JAPANESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED-STATES; TRANSACTION COST THEORY; INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS	CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; MODE; VENTURES; CHOICE; ENTRY; SUBSIDIARIES; PERFORMANCE; COSTS; FIRM	Multinational firms can enter a foreign market by taking over existing local firms (acquisitions) or by setting up new ventures (greenfield investments). Surprisingly, there has been limited empirical work on this topic. This paper examines the determinants of this choice by looking at Japanese entries into the United States. By focusing on firms of one country entering a single market, we are able to separate the impact of a firm's strategy from that of the characteristics of the target industry or country. This paper tests simultaneously a number of competing hypotheses. The results suggest that acquisitions are used by Japanese investors with weak competitive advantages, while investors with strong advantages find that greenfield investments are a more efficient way to transfer these advantages to the U.S. Acquisitions are also chosen to enter industries with either very high or very low growth rates, when entry is at a scale that is large relative to the parent, and when entry is into a different industry. The Japanese investor's previous experience of the U.S. market, its financial situation, and its status as a follower in an oligopolistic industry have no statistically significant impact on the entry mode. Neither do U.S. stock market conditions.		HENNART, JF (reprint author), UNIV ILLINOIS,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61820, USA.

J	NUTT, PC				NUTT, PC			THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOLUTION IDEAS DURING ORGANIZATIONAL DECISION-MAKING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING; CREATING ALTERNATIVES; DECISION SUCCESS		This research investigated the idea development stage of a strategic decision making process. The tactics that decision makers apply to identify ideas were uncovered from a systematic study of 168 decision cases. These tactics and contextual factors describing the decision situation were analyzed to determine how each influences success measured by decision merit, development time, initial adoption, and sustained adoption. A ''synthesized template'' which integrated useful practices and procedures from several sources had the most success, but this tactic was seldom used. A ''cyclical search'' in which repeated searches were carried out to learn about opportunities was quite successful when used under conditions of low importance, low urgency, and good staff support. The success of the design tactic, which calls for innovation, improved when urgency was present and multiple alternatives were sought. The idea tactic which imposed a fully developed solution was widely used and seldom successful.

These approximations offer significant advantages over the PERT formulas currently being taught and used, as well as over recently proposed modifications. For instance, they are several orders of magnitude more accurate than their PERT counterparts in estimating means and variances of beta distributions if the data required for all methods are obtained accurately. Moreover, they utilize probability data that can be assessed more reliably than those required by the PERT formulas, while still requiring just three points from each activity time probability distribution. Using the proposed approximations can significantly improve the accuracy of probability statements about project completion time, and their use complements ongoing efforts to improve PERT analyses of networks involving multiple critical paths.

An allocation policy is specified by: (a) the number of withdrawals from warehouse stock; (b) the intervals between successive withdrawals; (c) the quantity of stock to be withdrawn from the warehouse in each interval; and (d) the division of withdrawn stock among the retailers. We show that in the case of two withdrawals, available stock in each interval should be divided to ''balance'' retailer inventories. We also develop an infinite-retailer model and use it to determine two-interval allocation heuristics for N-retailer systems. Simulation tests suggest that the infinite-retailer heuristic policies are near-optimal for as few as two retailers. Simulation tests indicate that the risk-pooling benefits of allocation policies with two well-chosen intervals are comparable to those of base-stock policies with four equal intervals.

This method depends on central limit theorems for regenerative processes and weakly consistent estimates for the variance constants arising in the central limit theorems. A weak sufficient condition for both the central limit theorems and consistent estimates is given. Previous authors have implicitly made stronger moment assumptions which have led to strongly consistent variance estimates, more than is needed for the regenerative method to hold. The relationship between conditions for the validity of the regenerative method and those for the validity of standardized time series methods is also discussed.

A confidence-region-construction algorithm for a general autoregressive model is given. We establish the asymptotic validity of the confidence-region estimator (that is, the exact achievement of nominal coverage probability as the sample size tends to infinity) when the output process is a stationary vector autoregressive process of known, finite order. With respect to confidence-region volume, coverage probability, and execution time, we carry out an experimental performance comparison of VAR versus the methods of Bonferroni Batch Means (BBM), Multivariate Batch Means (MBM), and Multivariate Spectral Analysis (SPA). The experimental results indicate that (i) VAR delivered confidence regions with the smallest volume; (ii) BBM delivered confidence regions with the largest volume, the highest coverage and the smallest execution time; (iii) in small samples, all of the methods might yield confidence-region estimators whose coverage differs significantly from the nominal level; and (iv) in large samples for which the sample autocorrelation function indicates a vector autoregressive dependence structure, VAR is a viable technique for simulation output analysis.

J	GREENLEAF, EA; RAO, AG; SINHA, AR				GREENLEAF, EA; RAO, AG; SINHA, AR			GUARANTEES IN AUCTIONS - THE AUCTION HOUSE AS NEGOTIATOR AND MANAGERIAL DECISION-MAKER	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						AUCTIONS; GUARANTEES; NEGOTIATION; DECISION-MAKING	RISK AVERSE BUYERS	The multimillion dollar price guarantees that an auction house can offer for paintings have already had a large impact on auction house profits, and place new demands on the auctioneer's decision making and negotiating skills. Yet auctioneers have not been studied as independent entities and decision makers. To create a price guarantee, the auction house and the seller must negotiate both the guarantee amount and the extra commission the seller pays if the auction price exceeds the guarantee. We present a normative model of negotiations and find the frontier of guarantee and commission that is the Nash bargaining solution. We also determine the optimal reserve that the auctioneer should place on guaranteed property. We find that guarantees decrease the auction house's expected revenue compared to a conventional auction, but do allow it to attract business which might otherwise be lost. Guarantees benefit sellers, increasing the expected value and lowering the variance of their auction revenue. The auctioneer's optimal strategy depends not only on the distribution of the artwork's auction price, but also the price it will bring if it fails to sell at auction. In the latter case the auction house must pay the seller the guarantee and then sell the artwork, which it now owns, in a private secondary market where buyers regard the property as ''damaged goods'' and lower their offers. Although all points on the frontier produce equal expected revenue, several frequently used decision making rules suggest that both parties may prefer a guarantee arrangement where the seller pays no additional commission and the guarantee has the lowest value on the frontier.

Two alternative competitive scenarios are examined (i) in which total industry sales are allowed to vary over time, and (ii) where firms are engaged in market share rivalry. For (i), the open-loop Nash equilibrium advertising strategies for the firms are derived assuming a specific sales response function and an infinite time horizon. A numerical analysis of the sensitivity of firms' profit functions to advertising expenditures is performed at different levels of the (a) discount rate, (b) advertising elasticity, and (c) advertising decay rate. An empirical illustration from the pharmaceutical industry is provided. Special cases of the model formulation are examined analytically in order to highlight the intuition behind the flatness of the maximum and to study the sensitivity of results obtained to choice of equilibrium strategy (closed-loop vs. open-loop).

J	AUCAMP, DC				AUCAMP, DC			ON THE EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF PLAYS TO ACHIEVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE WITH THE GEOMETRIC MEAN STRATEGY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						GEOMETRIC MEAN RETURN; LOG UTILITY; LOG STRATEGY		The advantages of the Geometric Mean or Log Strategy have been well documented and recommended by many because a follower of this strategy will ultimately outperform in the long-run any other significantly different strategy, almost surely. This paper provides both theory and evidence to indicate that the ''long-run'' can be quite long in risky situations. These cases are typified by many business ventures and undiversified speculative investments in OTC securities. On the other hand, it is shown that the Log Strategy can ''virtually dominate'' in a moderate number of plays in cases when risk is low.

Two types of nonoverlapping service times, with respect to (w.r.t.) tasks and w.r.t. customers, are defined; it is not required that service times be independent. For nonoverlapping service times w.r.t. tasks, we bound the sample-path difference in number of customers in system by one, and bound the corresponding time-average difference by the traffic intensity of the longest station. For nonoverlapping service times w.r.t. customers, we bound the difference in mean sojourn time when the service times are bounded random variables. While we are motivated by probabilistic results, our methods and results are entirely deterministic.

However, the growth-optimal strategy entails a considerable risk of losing a substantial portion of wealth for the investment in the short run. This paper extends the long-run capital growth criterion to a multiperiod investment policy which maximizes the capital growth and at the same time achieves a given probability of maintaining an accumulated risk-free return over an finite investment horizon.

The conditions under which portfolio choices are separable from consumption decisions are derived. Unless the appropriate restrictions hold on investors' preferences or on the probability distribution of risks, the optimal portfolio is affected by other risks. This requires generalizing the usual measures of risk aversion. With one risky asset, matrix measures of risk aversion are used to generalize the results of Arrow (1965) and Pratt (1964) concerning the effects of risk aversion and wealth on the optimal portfolio. With two risky assets, the choices made by two investors coincide if and only if their generalized risk-aversion measures are identical. Ross's notion of stronger risk aversion is then used to characterize the effect of risk aversion on the level of investment in the riskier asset.

The greater the range, the greater the weight has to be. Experimental results show that subjects do not adjust their judgments properly if the range is varied. For the two methods tested the adjustment is smaller than required by theory. The bias was smaller for a regression procedure than for the direct ratio method. Weights based on an intuitive range were not found to be superior to those elicited over different ranges.

J	ANUPINDI, R; AKELLA, R				ANUPINDI, R; AKELLA, R			DIVERSIFICATION UNDER SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DUAL SOURCING; SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY; INVENTORY	YIELD; MODEL	Supply chain management is becoming an increasingly important issue, especially when in most industries the cost of materials purchased comprises 40-60% of the total sales revenue. Despite the benefits cited for single sourcing in the popular literature, there is enough evidence of industries having two/three sources for most parts. In this paper we address the operational issue of quantity allocation between two uncertain suppliers and its effects on the inventory policies of the buyer. Based on the type of delivery contract a buyer has with the suppliers, we suggest three models for the supply process. Model I is a one-delivery contract with all of the order quantity delivered either in the current period with probability beta, or in the next period with probability 1 - beta. Model II is also a one-delivery contract with a random fraction of the order quantity delivered in the current period; the portion of the order quantity not delivered is cancelled. Model III is similar to Model Il with the remaining quantity delivered in the next period. We derive the optimal ordering policies that minimize the total ordering, holding and penalty costs with backlogging. We show that the optimal ordering policy in period n for each of these models is as follows: for x greater-than-or-equal-to u(n)BAR order nothing; for v(n)BAR less-than-or-equal-to X < u(n)BAR, use only one supplier; and for x < v(n)BAR, order from both suppliers. For the limiting case in the single period version of Model I, we derive conditions under which one would continue ordering from one or the other or both suppliers. For Model II, we give, sufficient conditions for not using the second (more expensive) supplier when the demand and yield distributions have some special form. For the single period version of Models II and III with equal marginal ordering costs we show that the optimal order quantities follow a ratio rule when demand is exponential and yields are either normal or gamma distributed.

J	NGUYEN, QC; STONE, RE				NGUYEN, QC; STONE, RE			A MULTIPERIOD MINIMAX RESOURCE-ALLOCATION PROBLEM WITH SUBSTITUTABLE RESOURCES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						RESOURCE ALLOCATION; SUBSTITUTABLE RESOURCES; MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; MULTIPERIOD ANALYSIS	ALGORITHM	In this paper we consider a multiperiod resource allocation model in which the resources are storable and substitutable. A specific application of this model relates to the multiperiod production planning for electronic circuit board assembly factories. In this case, resources are electronic components, which are storable, that is, excess components in one period can be used in subsequent periods. Components that can be used in the same function on a circuit board are considered substitutable. Substitutability between components, however, may be dependent upon the specific circuit board on which they reside. Given that there are certain production requirements for the circuit boards, and that some components are in short supply, our algorithm (a) revises the production levels of the affected circuit boards, and (b) efficiently allocates the available components according to the revised production, so as to minimize the maximum weighted deviation from the original production plans. The weights reflect the relative importance of the circuit boards. The objective function uses cumulative production levels and cumulative demands to allow for back-scheduling. We present a primal-dual algorithm that is very efficient. An implementation of the algorithm compares favorably with a standard linear programming code. We solved a problem with 300 components, 20 different circuit boards (average of 10 functions/board) for 10 time periods (approximately 30,000 variables) in less than one minute on a VAX 11/785. We also discuss upper and lower bound extensions, and a lexicographic algorithm to ensure that less critical resources are also allocated effectively.

However, when more than two systems are compared, exact simultaneous statistical inference in conjunction with CRN is typically impossible. We introduce control-variate models of CRN that permit exact statistical inference, specifically multiple comparison's with the best. These models explain the effect of CRN via a linear regression of the simulation output on ''control variates'' that are functions of the simulation inputs. We establish theoretically, and illustrate empirically, that the control-variate models lead to sharper statistical inference in the sense that the probability of detecting differences in systems' performance is increased.

J	BISCHAK, DP; KELTON, WD; POLLOCK, SM				BISCHAK, DP; KELTON, WD; POLLOCK, SM			WEIGHTED BATCH MEANS FOR CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS IN STEADY-STATE SIMULATIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SIMULATION; CONFIDENCE INTERVALS; BATCH MEANS	DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION; STARTUP PROBLEM; ESTIMATORS	We propose a new procedure for providing confidence-interval estimators of the mean of a covariance-stationary process. The procedure, a modification of the method of batch means, is an improvement over existing methods when the process displays strong correlation and a comparatively small number of observations is available. We assign weights to the observations within a batch. The weights are determined by the order of the time-series model fit to the process and by its estimated parameters. For a given model and its parameters, the weights minimize the variance of the weighted point estimator of the mean; the point and variance estimators formed when these optimal weights are applied are unbiased. The time-series identification procedure and estimation of the parameters and weights bring in bias. Formulas for optimal weights are given for AR(p) and MA(1) processes. Experiments were conducted on AR(1), AR(2), and MA(2) processes as well as on the M/M/1 queue delay process and a periodic inventory system cost process. Results show that for processes with strong correlation over many lags, as is typical in queue-delay processes and inventory processes, the achieved coverage of the constructed interval is closer to nominal levels than for the unweighted-batch-means method. The coverage and average half-length is not as greatly affected by the number of batches, and nonnormality of the weighted batch means is not as severe.

J	WHITT, W				WHITT, W			LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN A DETERMINISTIC MULTICLASS NETWORK OF QUEUES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTICLASS QUEUING NETWORKS; OPEN QUEUING NETWORKS; CLASS-DEPENDENT SERVICE TIMES; HEAVY-TRAFFIC LIMITS; DIFFUSION APPROXIMATIONS; PRIORITIES; STABILITY CRITERIA		In this paper we investigate a relatively simple deterministic four-class two-queue multiclass open network of single-server FIFO queues with traffic intensity one at each queue. Our purpose is to better understand the effect of feedback with class-dependent service times at the queues. The example is sufficiently tractable that we are able to describe its transient behavior in great detail. The transient behavior depends strongly on the initial conditions and, for some initial conditions, the sample paths of the queue-length processes at individual stations have sudden large fluctuations (a large jump up followed immediately by a large jump down). These large fluctuations occur because batches of customers with short service times build up in the queues. Consistent with recent work by Dai and Wang (1993) on Brownian network models, these fluctuations rule out conventional heavy-traffic limit theorems. We show how to obtain proper heavy-traffic limits for this example by weakening the topology or enlarging the space of prospective limits (and changing the topology). This example also dramatically demonstrates a disadvantage of the FIFO discipline compared to other disciplines like head-of-the-line processor-sharing (HOL-PS) among the classes at each queue (under which, the large fluctuations do not occur). Finally, the critical arrival rate for stability in our example actually depends on the service discipline, being even lower if the classes with longer service times are given high priority at each queue. This phenomenon can occur in the network setting because individual queues can be empty when there is work in the network.		WHITT, W (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS,MURRAY HILL,NJ 07974, USA.

Geometric stable distributions, with Laplace distribution playing the role of a ''normal'' law, have been found to give better fit to such data. We study the ''stability'' properties of Laplace and a mixture of Laplace and Weibull and discuss the statistical inference for such mixture models.

J	LAL, R; SRINIVASAN, V				LAL, R; SRINIVASAN, V			COMPENSATION PLANS FOR SINGLE-PRODUCT AND MULTIPRODUCT SALESFORCES - AN APPLICATION OF THE HOLMSTROM-MILGROM MODEL	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SALESFORCE COMPENSATION; AGENCY THEORY; SALESFORCE MANAGEMENT	COMMISSION	The agency theory approach to understanding salesforce compensation plans is modified to incorporate the intratemporal nature of the salesperson's effort-rate decision, i.e., the decision about the effort-rate at any given point in time potentially depends upon the sales performance up to that point in time in the accounting period. Under the assumptions considered in this paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987) have shown that the optimal compensation plan is linear in total sales over the accounting period. The comparative statics results obtained here corroborate most of the corresponding results in the salesforce compensation literature; moreover, we derive many additional results not available in the literature. It is demonstrated that the commission income as a fraction of total compensation goes up with an increase in the effectiveness of the sales-effort or an increase in base sales. On the other hand, the salary component of the total compensation goes up with increases in uncertainty, absolute risk aversion, marginal cost of production, perceived cost of effort, and/or alternative job opportunities for the salesperson. We provide a discussion of different selling situations where our results may be more or less applicable. An examination of empirical studies already available in the literature reveals support for our findings regarding the relative emphasis of salary and incentive pay in the compensation plan. We also extend the agency theory approach to compare commission rates across products for a multiproduct salesperson. Here it is shown that commission rates are higher for products with higher sales-effort effectiveness, lower levels of uncertainty, and/or lower marginal costs.

Communication of the agent's information is always valuable. The optimal contract given this information asymmetry is characterized by less production and a larger risk premium than when information is symmetric, leading to an efficiency loss. Comparative statics show that the loss in expected production increases as the agent becomes more risk averse.

J	SHELLEY, MK				SHELLEY, MK			OUTCOME SIGNS, QUESTION FRAMES AND DISCOUNT RATES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DISCOUNT RATES; DECISION MAKING; FRAMING; INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; TIME PREFERENCE	DECISION	This study explains why gain/loss discount rate differences reported in previous studies cannot be attributed to outcome sign alone, but rather, must be associated with particular outcome-sign/question-frame combinations. To do so, it extends Loewenstein's (1988) framing model of intertemporal choice to negative outcomes and uses the resulting predictions to interpret and integrate the results of three previous studies comparing subjective discount rates (Thaler 1981, Loewenstein 1988, Benzion et al. 1989). The new framework reveals previously unidentified linkages among outcome signs, question frames, and discount rates. To investigate whether losses and gains are, in fact, discounted differently, an experiment is conducted that includes a neutral-frame intertemporal choice scenario (no proposed change in outcome timing) for each outcome sign. The results show that subjective discount rates vary in a predictable way according to the outcome sign and question frame combination examined.

The models that result provide explicit and detailed descriptions of stochastic systems. We show how covariance structure models are related-mathematically, conceptually, philosophically and practically-to Gaussian influence diagrams as described by Shachter and Kenley (1989). This relationship suggests ways in which covariance structure modeling can be used to advantage in the prescriptive domain of decision analysis. The paper includes an example concerning the management of hazardous materials, in which a covariance structure model is converted to an influence diagram for use in a prescriptive analysis.

J	TURNER, AL; HENSEL, CR				TURNER, AL; HENSEL, CR			WERE THE RETURNS FROM STOCKS AND BONDS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES REALLY DIFFERENT IN THE 1980S	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TESTS OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; GLOBAL EQUITY; FIXED INCOME AND CASH RETURNS; CURRENCY HEDGING		We analyzed the total equity returns of indexes from Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US and total fixed income returns of indexes from all but Australia (excluded due to lack of data) to see if the returns of stocks and bonds were statistically different across markets during the 1980s. At the end of 1989, these countries represented over 87% of the market capitalization of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Equity Index and over 88% of the Salomon Brothers World Bond Index. This study used monthly observations from January 1980 through December 1989 and examined returns based in local currency and hedged and unhedged US dollars. We found that sample mean stock and bond returns during the 1980s were statistically indistinguishable across countries. However, because the sample variances were so large relative to the sample means, it would have been difficult to detect differences in population means by any test. We found evidence of variance heterogeneity, which may be explainable by other economic factors. We also found that intercountry stock and bond correlations were not significantly different. Thus, we confirmed the results of other researchers, such as Jobson and Korkie (1981), but in a broader global context using more asset types and different statistical tests. Our work suggests reducing the number of input estimates to a MV global asset allocation problem.

It is well known that MV allocations are very sensitive to small forecast errors in the means and covariances. This sensitivity is especially pronounced for errors in means. One way to control this sensitivity to forecast errors is to use Stein estimation. We examined three naive applications of Stein estimation for six individual country stock indexes, five country bond indexes and five cash indexes. This study has two major conclusions. First, any of the suggested adjustments to inputs dominate the results of an unadjusted-input MV optimization. Adjusted-input portfolios have higher mean return, less variance and greater terminal wealth than unadjusted-input portfolios. Second, these improvements become even greater with transaction costs.

Future returns are estimated via the empirical probability assessment approach. The results show that (i) with quarterly revision, the MV model approximates the dynamic model very well; (ii) with annual revision, there are often sharp differences between the power function model and the MV approximation; and (iii) these differences become even larger when the quadratic approximation is used.

This classic production problem is concerned with determining optimal production lot sizes for a given set of products using a common facility. CCSP is based on scheduling all products using a common (base) cycle time, so that the lot size for each product is the forecasted demand for that product over the base cycle time. This research provides an optimizing framework for CCSP for a multi-stage, multi-product, flow-shop environment under deterministic and stationary conditions, assuming a fixed sequence is maintained across all processing stages. The framework presented considers the costs of work-in-process inventory and determines a jointly optimal common cycle time and production schedule (start and finish times for each product's production lot-size) for the multi-stage facility in question. The paper also reports some results on the impact of alternative sequencing rules for the CCSP context.

It is shown that inferences about the population parameters from such unrepresentative samples are not only possible but can be statistically powerful, provided the selection biases are adequately controlled for and the specification of the model is appropriate. The model assumptions are sufficiently flexible to accommodate a variety of stochastic processes with heterogeneous event frequencies. In an example, the model is applied to data on robbery rates for prison inmates in order to estimate the robbery rates for all offenders. The model fits the data well, and the results show that the bias toward high rate offenders among prison inmates is substantial.

With this approach, decision analysis optimization methods can be applied to complex decision problems which are generally analyzed in management science practice using heuristics. Using the approach, a decision problem is formulated in terms of decision variables, random variables, and functions relating these variables. This leads to a compact representation, and a simple algorithm can be used to quickly solve algebraic models that would have decision trees with several hundred thousand endpoints. An application to research and development planning illustrates the usefulness of such large sequential decision models.

The problem is especially important today since costs for flying personnel of major U.S. carriers have grown and now often exceed $1.3 billion a year and are the second largest item (next to fuel cost) of the total operating cost of major U.S. carriers. Thus even small percentage savings amount to substantial dollar amounts. We present a branch-and-cut approach to solving to proven optimality large set partitioning problems arising within the airline industry. We first provide some background related to this important application and then describe the approach for solving representative problems in this problem class. The branch-and-cut solver generates cutting planes based on the underlying structure of the polytope defined by the convex hull of the feasible integer points and incorporates these cuts into a tree-search algorithm that uses automatic reformulation procedures, heuristics and linear programming technology to assist in the solution. Numerical experiments are reported for a sample of 68 large-scale real-world crew scheduling problems. These problems include both pure set partitioning problems and set partitioning problems with side constraints. These ''base constraints'' represent contractual labor requirements and have heretofore not been represented explicitly in the construction of crew schedules thus making it impossible to provide any measure of how far the obtained solution was from optimality. An interesting result of obtaining less costly schedules is that the crews themselves are happier with the schedules because they spend more of their duty time flying than waiting on the ground.

The first is purely expository: to introduce stochastic interest-rate models and security-evaluation methods in a simple mathematical setting. Specifically, we assume the uncertainties in the model are represented by a discrete-time, finite-state Markov chain. Second, using this framework, we present a relatively simple model for the evaluation of mortgage-backed securities.

The model is based on a two-factor model of the term structure of interest rates and embeds an empirically estimated mortgage prepayment function. The model is used to analyze various CMO tranches, including standard sequential pay fixed-rate tranches, Planned Amortization Class (PAC) tranches, Targeted Amortization Class (TAC) tranches, floating-rate tranches, Interest Only (IO) and Principal Only (PO) tranches, Z-bonds and Residuals. The results of this analysis illustrate the sensitivity of the various tranches to differences in CMO structure, changes in interest rates, the characteristics of the underlying collateral, and mortgage prepayments.

This model assumes stationary, deterministic demand rates and a standard stationary cost structure; it is a generalization of the uncapacitated model treated in the seminal papers of Maxwell and Muckstadt (1985) and Roundy (1986). The capacity constraints consist of bounds on the frequency with which individual items can or need to be replenished. We derive a pair of simple and efficient algorithms capable of determining an optimal power-of-two policy. These algorithms consist of a limited number of maximum flow computations in networks closely related to the production/distribution network. The complexity of these algorithms, even when applied to the uncapacitated model, compares favorably with that of the existing alternative solution methods.

This sequence is set to achieve the primary goal of an organization operating under a JIT system, which is to maintain a constant rate of part usage. In this paper, a graph-theoretic approach is used to determine an optimal solution for this goal for a new, nonconvex objective function. Furthermore, it is shown that a schedule always exists such that, at all times, the deviation of actual production from the desired level of production for every product is never more than one unit.

The system was developed to permit quick response to schedule changes and to reduce crew scheduling costs. It was designed to work efficiently for both the medium sized problems (300 flights daily) and the very large problems (1,700 flights daily) that United must solve. The system has two main components, a generator and an optimizer. The generator creates pairings (candidate crew trips) which are fed as variables to the optimizer as an elastic embedded set partitioning integer programming problem. The optimizer then seeks to find a set of pairings that covers all of the flight segments exactly once with minimal cost. Once a disjoint solution has been found, the system cycles between the generator and the optimizer to improve it. Savings of $16,000,000 annually in crew scheduling costs have been obtained.

In particular, it analyzes the difficulties caused by the conventions that each model component must have a fixed number of indices and that the order of the indices is significant to their meaning. To deal with these difficulties compensating extensions to algebraic notation are proposed. The proposed notation is compared to existing notation in terms of the human abilities to understand, maintain and verify model descriptions.

For large-scale linear programming problems, such operations consume the great majority of the computation time required. However, for problems where the number of variables far exceeds the number of constraints, operations over the entire constraint matrix are unnecessary. We will examine and extend decomposition techniques which greatly reduce the amount of work required by such interior point methods as the dual affine scaling and the dual potential reduction algorithms. In an effort to judge the practical viability of the decompositioning, we compare the performance of the dual potential reduction algorithm with and without decompositioning over a set of randomly generated transportation problems. Accompanying a theoretical justification of these techniques, we focus on the implementation details and computational results of one such technique.

J	ASSUNCAO, JL; MEYER, RJ				ASSUNCAO, JL; MEYER, RJ			THE RATIONAL EFFECT OF PRICE PROMOTIONS ON SALES AND CONSUMPTION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING; BUYER BEHAVIOR; PRICING; PROMOTION	STRATEGIES	We explore the rational effect of price variation on sales and consumption in markets where consumers are uncertain about the future price of goods. We first derive an optimal ordering policy which expresses the amount a consumer should purchase and consume in a given period as a function of the observed price of the good, the distribution of future prices, and the nature of his or her inventory. This policy extends previous normative models of inventory control, such as those by Golabi (1985) and Kalymon (1970) to the case where the amount to consume in a given period is an explicit decision variable and prices follow a first-order stochastic process. We then use this model to explore how changes in the long-run frequency and temporal correlations of price promotions should normatively affect the contemporaneous relationship between purchase, consumption and price. Among the predictions which follow from the model are that consumption should rationally increase with the size of existing inventories, the short-term sensitivity of sales to prices should be greater than that of consumption to price, and this discrepancy increases with decreases in the temporal correlation of price deals and the long-term relative frequency of price deals.

J	MOINZADEH, K; INGENE, C				MOINZADEH, K; INGENE, C			AN INVENTORY MODEL OF IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED DELIVERY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING, CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION; PRICING; INVENTORY MANAGEMENT	DISCOUNT	This paper considers the long run, profit maximizing strategy of a distributor that holds a good (good 1) in inventory for immediate delivery and that offers a second good (good 2) for delayed delivery. When the two goods are substitutes, an out-of-stock situation for good 1 will cause some consumers (''walkers'') to seek the good elsewhere, other consumers (''waiters'') to accept a raincheck for later delivery of good 1, and others still (''switchers'') to place an order for good 2. It is shown that a profit maximizing strategy may entail setting a price for the delayed delivery item so as to encourage switching behavior. The rationale is that the distributor can hold a smaller inventory, thereby incurring lower holding costs, because out-of-stock situations are less costly than they would be without some consumers being willing to switch.

J	GRAY, AE; SEIDMANN, A; STECKE, KE				GRAY, AE; SEIDMANN, A; STECKE, KE			A SYNTHESIS OF DECISION-MODELS FOR TOOL MANAGEMENT IN AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; PRODUCTION PLANNING; CIM; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SYSTEMS; MACHINE; SELECTION; FMS; AVAILABILITY; MINIMIZATION; COMMONALITY; OPTIMALITY; OPERATION	The evidence is clear that a lack of attention to structured tool management has resulted in the poor performance of many manufacturing systems. Plant tooling systems affect product design options, machine loading, job batching, capacity scheduling, and real-time part routing decisions. With increasing automation in manufacturing systems, there is a growing need to integrate tool management more thoroughly into system design, planning and control. This paper critically evaluates various tool management approaches, identifying the operational tradeoffs and analyzing the models developed to address management decisions involving tooling. These decisions range from selecting the optimal machining parameters and the most economic processing rate for a particular operation, to the loading of tools and jobs on machines and the determination of the optimal tool-mix inventories needed for a particular production schedule. We present an integrated conceptual framework for resource planning to examine how tool management issues, depending upon their scope, can be classified into tool-level, machine-level, and system-level concerns. This framework specifies how decisions made at one level constrain those at lower levels, and how information from lower levels feeds back to higher level decisions. The framework structures our critical evaluation of the modeling approaches found in the academic literature and points to promising directions for future research.

Skewness is generated by a single factor for the whole economy, but upon which different securities have different loadings. This results in three-fund separation-two funds to span the spherical risk and one more fund to span the additional skewness risk. A three-parameter normative portfolio analysis that allows short sales restrictions is developed. In addition, a three-parameter capital asset pricing model is provided.

J	SIMAAN, Y				SIMAAN, Y			WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF MEAN-VARIANCE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FINANCE; PORTFOLIO SELECTION; MEAN-VARIANCE ANALYSIS; PEARSON TYPE 3 DISTRIBUTION		An analytical framework is set up to evaluate the foregone opportunity cost of mean-variance investment strategies. A parametric structure of the joint distribution of security returns, for which mean-variance investment strategy is suboptimal, is specified. For all constant absolute risk-aversion investors, the optimal strategy, its corresponding mean-variance alternative, and the foregone opportunity cost of mean-variance investment strategy are analytically derived and operationalized empirically. When the investor's opportunity set includes the riskless asset, the premium to replace the mean-variance investment strategy by its optimal one does not exceed 0.05 cents on an invested dollar regardless of the investor's risk aversion. When the riskless asset is denied, the opportunity costs of mean-variance investment strategies increase with the degree of risk aversion.

The problem arises when a fiduciary is required to distribute the assets-of a trust or estate, or to divide the property in a divorce or in dissolution of a partnership-in which the assets have separate market values and tax bases. In other variations of this problem, the beneficiaries are presumed also to possess an infinitely divisible asset, such as cash, or some of the assets may be liquidated. Models for combining consideration of subjective values for the assets in addition to the objective market values are considered. Computational methods for these problems are discussed and illustrated.		WEINGARTNER, HM (reprint author), VANDERBILT UNIV,OWEN GRAD SCH MANAGEMENT,NASHVILLE,TN 37235, USA.

Many decisions are, however, made in market settings where an individual's decision is influenced by decisions of others participating in the market. In this paper, we extend the previous research to evaluate the effect of ambiguity on individual decisions and the resulting market price in market settings. We therefore examine an important issue: whether ambiguity effects persist in the face of market incentives and feedback. Two different market organizations, the sealed bid auction and the double oral auction, were employed. The subjects in the experiments were graduate business students and bank executives. Our results show that the individual bids and market prices for lotteries with ambiguous probabilities are consistently lower than the corresponding bids and market prices for equivalent lotteries with well-defined probabilities. The aversion to ambiguity therefore does not vanish in market settings. Our results provide insights into what a manager can expect in bidding situations where the object of the sale (oil leases, mineral rights) involves ambiguity in probability due to, for example, lack of information or prior experience. The results may also be useful in understanding some phenomena in insurance and equity markets.

It presents a two-Stage decomposition mechanism that proves to be powerful in solving the problem completely or reducing it to a much smaller problem. Three types of orderings of adjacent jobs are derived that play a crucial role in problem decomposition. The decomposition method solves 155 out of 320 test problems with job sizes ranging from 20 to 150. It reduces 163 unsolved problems to smaller subproblems with sizes not exceeding 25 jobs. The job sizes of the remaining two unsolved subproblems are 30 and 45.		SZWARC, W (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,SCH BUSINESS ADM,MILWAUKEE,WI 53201, USA.

The stage with nonzero setup is defined to be the bottleneck; it may be thought of as the critical resource whose throughput largely determines the throughput of the entire system, as a envisioned by the OPT philosophy. Production is in lots with uncertain (binomial) yields and demand needs to be satisfied in full, thus possibly necessitating multiple production runs. We show how the optimal control problem can be reduced to that of optimal lotsizing a single stage.

J	GERWIN, D				GERWIN, D			MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY - A STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT; FOCUSED FACTORY	SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE	To help meet competitive realities operations managers need to know more about the strategic aspects of manufacturing flexibility. This paper takes steps toward meeting that need by critically reviewing the literature and establishing a research agenda for the area. A conceptual model, which places flexibility within a broad context, helps to identify certain assumptions of theoretical studies which need to be challenged. The model also provides a basis for identifying specific flexibility dimensions. The manner in which these dimensions may limit the effectiveness of a manufacturing process, and the problems in operationalizing them are discussed. Focusing next on the neglected area of applied work, concepts are presented for analyzing whether desired amounts of flexibility are being achieved and whether the potential for flexibility built into a manufacturing process is being tapped. Once more, a procedure is outlined for altering a plant's types and amounts of flexibility over time. The research agenda, which grows out of the appraisal of theoretical and applied work, indicates the value in studying generic flexibility strategies, the flexibility dimensions, methods of delivery, ways of evaluating and changing a process's flexibility, and above all measurement problems. The conclusions indicate principles for strategic research, some of which have relevance for the development of mathematical models.

This has led researchers to examine alternatives to outcome feedback for improving decision makers' performance in such tasks. This study examines the feasibility of improving performance in dynamic tasks by providing cognitive feedback or feedforward. We report a laboratory experiment in which subjects managed a set of simulated software development projects. Results indicate that subjects provided with cognitive feedback performed best, followed by those provided with feedforward. Subjects provided with outcome feedback performed poorly. We discuss the implications of the results for decision support in dynamic tasks.		SENGUPTA, K (reprint author), USN,POSTGRAD SCH,DEPT ADM SCI,MONTEREY,CA 93943, USA.

Current DFM practices encourage the minimization of the number of parts in a design through the physical integration of several geometric features in the same part. While this part integration often reduces the manufacturing cost of the product, it also can extend product development lead time, because complex parts typically require tooling with large lead times. This paper presents an economic model that makes explicit the trade-off between lower unit costs and longer product development time. This model is applied to a particular example in a field study of the application of DFM to Polaroid cameras.		ULRICH, K (reprint author), MIT,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139, USA.

The agents may, for example, be divisional managers, market researchers, OR consultants, financial analysts, corporate auditors, research scientists or political pollsters. We show that an agent should be compensated more for making a correct rather than an incorrect prediction, and for agreeing rather than disagreeing with colleagues. Depending on the environment, correctness should be compensated more or less than agreement. Also, compensation should increase with the difficulties of making correct or conforming predictions. One consequence of the result is that it may sometimes reduce a principal's total incentive costs to engage with more information producers performing parallel investigations, because the possibility to make relative performance evaluations of the agents may substantially reduce the costs of motivating the agents in performing their duties as desired.

J	CAULKINS, JP				CAULKINS, JP			ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICIES - DO THEY INHIBIT OR STIMULATE ILLICIT DRUG CONSUMPTION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ILLICIT DRUG POLICY; JUDICIAL LEGAL, LAW; REGULATION		Some have suggested fighting the drug problem with so-called ''zero-tolerance'' policies that impose stiff sanctions for possession of even trace amounts of illicit drugs. Such policies can swamp the criminal justice system and violate the principle that the punishment should fit the crime, but these objections have often been suppressed by an overriding desire to minimize consumption. This paper argues to the contrary that under plausible conditions zero-tolerance policies may actually encourage controlled users to consume more, not less, than they would if the punishment increased in proportion to the quantity possessed at the time of arrest. This result holds even if for every quantity the punishment under the proportional policy is less than or equal to that under the zero-tolerance policy. The argument relies on a mathematical model that describes how a typical controlled user's purchasing habits are affected by the punishment anticipated as a function of the quantity possessed. A variety of possible punishment policies are evaluated. The consumption minimizing policy for a given individual user is obtained, as well as the consumption minimizing policy that belongs to a restricted class of policies that are more likely to be politically feasible.

DLSP is the problem of determining the sequence and size of production batches for multiple items on a single machine. The objective is to find a minimal cost production schedule such that dynamic demand is fulfilled without backlogging. DLSP is formulated as a Set Partitioning Problem (SPP). We present a dual ascent and column generation heuristic to solve SPP. The quality of the solutions can be measured, since the heuristic generates lower and upper bounds. Computational results on a personal computer show that the heuristic is rather effective, both in terms of quality of the solutions as well as in terms of required memory and computation time.

A Monte Carlo simulation experiment was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the bootstrap method with the method suggested by Lau, Wingender and Lau (1989) to test skewness persistence. The results show the bootstrap method to be more powerful than the other method. The bootstrap method was also used to determine the persistence of skewness in stock returns. The results show that, in a large percentage of stocks, skewness persists over time.		MURALIDHAR, K (reprint author), FLORIDA INT UNIV,DEPT DECIS SCI & INFORMAT SYST,MIAMI,FL 33199, USA.

J	LAGUNA, M; GLOVER, F				LAGUNA, M; GLOVER, F			BANDWIDTH PACKING - A TABU SEARCH APPROACH	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TABU SEARCH; K-SHORTEST PATHS; CALL ROUTING		The bandwidth packing (BWP) problem is a combinatorially difficult problem arising in the area of telecommunications. The problem consists of assigning calls to paths in a capacitated graph, such that capacities are not violated and the total profit is maximized. In this paper we discuss the development of a tabu search (TS) method for the BWP problem. The method makes use of an efficient implementation of the k-shortest path algorithm, that allows the identification of a controlled set of feasible paths for each call. A tabu search is then performed to find the best path assignment for each call. The TS method developed here incorporates a number of features that have proved useful for obtaining optimal and near optimal solutions to difficult combinatorial problems. We establish the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance in speed and solution quality to other specialized heuristics and to a standard optimization package applied to a 0-1 integer programming formulation of the problem.

Aggregating the diverse bits of information is an important aspect of the decision-making process but entails special statistical modeling problems in characterizing the information. Prior research in this area has relied primarily on the use of historical data as a basis for modeling the information sources. We develop a Bayesian framework that a decision maker can use to encode subjective knowledge about the information sources in order to aggregate point estimates of an unknown quantity of interest. This framework features a highly flexible environment for modeling the probabilistic nature and interrelationships of the information sources and requires straightforward and intuitive subjective judgments using proven decision-analysis assessment techniques. Analysis of the constructed model produces a posterior distribution for the quantity of interest. An example based on health risks due to ozone exposure demonstrates the technique.

A key objective of our research is to examine how firm characteristics such as their differential efficiencies in completing projects, differences in the degree of substitutability between Type A and B products, and first mover advantages affect product development strategies. We develop a game-theoretic model to obtain insights into the project selection problem taking into account competitive reactions to a firm's choice of project development strategies and technical uncertainties associated with project completion times. We report model findings on recommended project selection strategies for efficient and disadvantaged firms. Further, we examine how a firm's choice of a Type A project is affected by an increase in the variance of the project completion time of a Type A project relative to that of a Type B project, while the ratio of their mean completion times is held constant.

It is particularly suited for short and irregular time series data. In certain applications, time series data are available on numerous parallel observational units which, while not having cause-and-effect relationships between them, are subject to the same external forces (e.g., business cycles). Treating them separately may lose useful information for forecasting. For such situations, involving seemingly unrelated time series, this article develops a Bayesian forecasting method called C-MSKF that combines the MSKF method with the Conditionally Independent Hierarchical method, A case study on forecasting income tax revenue for each of forty school districts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, based on fifteen years of data, is used to illustrate the application of C-MSKF in comparison with univariate MSKF. Results show that C-MSKF is more accurate than MSKF. The relative accuracy of C-MSKF increases with decreasing length of historical time series data, increasing forecasting horizon, and sensitivity of school districts to the economic cycle.

The cell is designed for cyclic production of one product. This product is characterized by a sequence of operations of given length and each requiring a set of resources; the problem is therefore to allocate such resources and scheduling the operations in order to maximize the throughput. A general model is proposed and several special cases are discussed, corresponding to either polynomial or NP-complete problems. The cases analyzed differ from each other in the number of operating machines and in the number of product units present at the same time in the cell. The solution to the polynomial problems is given in terms of shortest path on particular networks.

J	MOSKOWITZ, H; PLANTE, R; TSAI, HT				MOSKOWITZ, H; PLANTE, R; TSAI, HT			A MULTISTAGE SCREENING MODEL FOR EVALUATION AND CONTROL OF MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR IN THE DETECTION OF HYPERTENSION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTISTAGE SCREENING MODEL; MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR, QUALITY CONTROL	BLOOD-PRESSURE; VARIABILITY	Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors with respect to coronary heart disease and stroke. The benefits of early detection of hypertension and the subsequent design of follow-up treatment programs are well documented. Consequently, screening programs have been designed to identify subjects as normotensive (normal) or hypertensive (abnormal). In order for these programs to be effective, full participation of the subject population is required. However, such classification programs can incur massive risks of incorrectly classifying subjects as normotensive who are truly hypertensive and incorrectly classifying subjects as hypertensive who are truly normotensive. To date, the only means to reduce these risks of misclassification is to require subjects to make numerous visits for blood pressure measurement before they can be classified. Such requirements reduce the level of participation in screening programs and also delay the identification of subjects who are truly hypertensive, thereby depriving them of the benefits of early detection and immediate follow-up treatment. We propose a multiple-stage screening model that controls for maximum as well as average misclassification error which is used to design and / or evaluate screening programs for hypertension. A multiple-stage screening model not only permits the early detection of subjects who are truly hypertensive, but also requires a much smaller level of participation of subjects, while retaining control of misclassification risks that are comparable to those of screening programs based on numerous visits. We then design multiple-stage screening programs for several different subject populations.

J	LIVNY, M; MELAMED, B; TSIOLIS, AK				LIVNY, M; MELAMED, B; TSIOLIS, AK			THE IMPACT OF AUTOCORRELATION ON QUEUING-SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						AUTOCORRELATION; AUTOCORRELATED ARRIVALS; AUTOCORRELATED SERVICES; QUEUING SYSTEMS; TES PROCESSES; MINIFICATION MAXIFICATION PROCESSES; WAITING TIMES		The performance of single-server queues with independent interarrival intervals and service demands is well understood, and often analytically tractable. In particular, the M / M / 1 queue has been thoroughly studied, due to its analytical tractability. Little is known, though, when autocorrelation is introduced into interarrival times or service demands, resulting in loss of analytical tractability. Even the simple case of an M / M / 1 queue with autocorrelations does not appear to be well understood. Such autocorrelations do, in fact, abound in real-life systems, and worse, simplifying independence assumptions can lead to very poor estimates of performance measures. This paper reports the results of a simulation study of the impact of autocorrelation on performance in an FIFO queue. The study used two computer methods for generating autocorrelated random sequences, with different autocorrelation characteristics. The simulation results show that the injection of autocorrelation into interarrival times, and to a lesser extent into service demands, can have a dramatic impact on performance measures. From a performance viewpoint, these effects are generally deleterious, and their magnitude depends on the method used to generate the autocorrelated process. The paper discusses these empirical results and makes some recommendations to practitioners of performance analysis of queuing systems.

J	SMITH, JE				SMITH, JE			MOMENT METHODS FOR DECISION-ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; APPROXIMATIONS; PROBABILITY MODELING	MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; APPROXIMATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS	Decision models involving continuous probability distributions almost always require some form of approximation. The usual approach to evaluating these kinds of models is to construct a discrete approximation for each continuous distribution and compute value lotteries and certain equivalents using these discrete approximations. Although decision analysts are quite comfortable with this approach, there has been relatively little consideration of how these discrete approximations affect the results of the analysis. In the first part of this paper, we review three common methods of constructing discrete approximations and compare their performance in a simple example. The results of the example suggest a different approach that offers potential improvements in accuracy and efficiency over the usual approach. The basic idea is that given discrete approximations that accurately represent the moments of assessed ''input'' distributions, we may easily and accurately compute the moments of the ''output'' distribution or value lotteries. These moments then summarize what we know about the value lottery and certain equivalent, and provide the basis for computing approximate value lotteries and certain equivalents. In this paper, we discuss the methods supporting this moment approach and evaluate their performance in the context of the example.

Such estimators provide a possible means for speeding up the convergence of gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithms. The derivation of the estimators sheds some new light on the complications encountered in applying the technique of SPA. The most general cases require the simulation of additional sample subpaths; however, an approximation procedure is also introduced which eliminates the need for additional simulation. Simulation results indicate that the approximation procedure is reasonably accurate. When the service times are exponential or deterministic, the estimator simplifies and the approximation procedure becomes exact. For the M / M / 2 queue, the estimator is proved to be strongly consistent.	BOSTON UNIV,BOSTON,MA 02215	FU, MC (reprint author), UNIV MARYLAND,COLL BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT,COLL PK,MD 20742, USA.

J	HARVEY, CM				HARVEY, CM			MULTIATTRIBUTE RISK LINEARITY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; MULTIATTRIBUTE TRADEOFFS; RISK ATTITUDES	UTILITY-FUNCTIONS; DEPENDENCE	In applying multiattribute utility theory, one typically assumes the condition of mutual utility independence and uses a multiattribute utility function that is additive or multiplicative. This paper proposes a model in which this condition is not satisfied, that is, the risk attitude for one attribute depends on the amounts of the other attributes. We introduce a condition on this dependence called ''multiattribute risk linearity'' that implies a logarithmic form for the multiattribute utility function, and we show that a logarithmic utility function can be determined by assessment procedures that require the same number of indifference assessments as those for a multiplicative utility function.

J	WADE, M				WADE, M			THE EFFECTS OF POPULATION AGING ON THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES MARKET - A COMPUTABLE EQUILIBRIUM-ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						EQUILIBRIUM MODEL; PHYSICIAN SERVICES; POPULATION AGING; SIMULATION	CONSUMER INFORMATION; DEMAND SYSTEMS; UNITED-STATES; CONSTRAINTS; MODEL	This paper formulates a computable equilibrium model (CEM) of the market for physician services. The simulation results based upon the CEM are consistent with widely held beliefs about the effects of aging on the health care sector, for example, that aggregate expenditures will increase as the population ages. In addition, however, the simulations suggest differential effects on prices and expenditures for various types of services and on expenditures by different types of consumers. For example, prices and aggregate expenditures for services typically used by the elderly are found to increase under ''older'' age distributions, whereas prices and aggregate expenditures for other services are found to decrease. Elderly women are found to be unequivocally worse off under older as opposed to younger age structures; they spend more yet consume fewer services.

J	DOBSON, G; KALISH, S				DOBSON, G; KALISH, S			HEURISTICS FOR PRICING AND POSITIONING A PRODUCT-LINE USING CONJOINT AND COST DATA	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCT-LINE DESIGN; PRODUCT POSITIONING; PRICING; CONJOINT ANALYSIS; HEURISTICS	ECONOMICS; VARIETY; ISSUES	Designing and pricing a product-line is the very essence of every business. In recent years quantitative methods to assist managers in this task have been gaining in popularity. Conjoint analysis is already widely used to measure preferences for different product profiles, and build market simulation models. In the last few years several papers have been published that suggest how to optimally choose a product-line based on such data. We formalize this problem as a mathematical program where the objective of the firm is either profit or total welfare. Unlike alternative published approaches, we introduce fixed and variable costs for each product profile. The number of products to be introduced is endogenously determined on the basis of their desirability, fixed and variable costs, and in the case of profits, their cannibalization effect on other products. While the problem is difficult (NP-complete), we show that the maximum welfare problem is equivalent to the uncapacitated plant location problem, which can be solved very efficiently using the greedy interchange heuristic. Based on past published experience with this problem, and on simulations we perform, we show that optimal or near optimal solutions are obtained in seconds for large problems. We develop a new greedy heuristic for the profit problem, and its application to simulated problems shows that it too runs quickly, and with better performance than various alternatives and previously published heuristics. We also show how the methodology can be applied, taking existing products of both the firm and the competition into account.

A method is proposed for obtaining and quantitatively evaluating verbal judgments in which each analyst uses a limited vocabulary that he or she has individually selected and scaled. An experiment compared this method to standard numerical responding under three different payoff conditions. Response mode and payoff never interacted. Probability scores and their components were virtually identical for the two response modes and for all payoff groups. Also, judgments of complementary events were essentially additive under all conditions. The two response modes differed in that the central response category was used more frequently in the numerical than the verbal case, while overconfidence was greater verbally than numerically. Response distributions and degrees of overconfidence were also affected by payoffs. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

J	SOGOMONIAN, AG; TANG, CS				SOGOMONIAN, AG; TANG, CS			A MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR COORDINATING PROMOTION AND PRODUCTION DECISIONS WITHIN A FIRM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING MANUFACTURING INTERFACE; PROMOTION; PRODUCTION; NETWORKS		This paper presents a modeling framework for evaluating the benefits of coordinating promotion and production decisions over a finite planning horizon within a firm. These decisions include the timing and level of promotion, and the level of production. The modeling framework consists of the development of a baseline model and an integrated model. In the baseline (integrated) model, the firm would consider those promotion and production decisions separately (jointly). For each of the models, we formulate the problem that determines the optimal promotion and production decisions so that the total net profit is maximized as a mixed integer program. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show that each problem can be reformulated as a ''longest path'' problem over a network. Hence, each problem can be solved efficiently. This solution approach enables us to evaluate the benefits of coordinating promotion and production decisions by comparing the total net profit generated by the baseline model to that of the integrated model.

J	IYOGUN, P; ATKINS, D				IYOGUN, P; ATKINS, D			A LOWER BOUND AND AN EFFICIENT HEURISTIC FOR MULTISTAGE MULTIPRODUCT DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article								This paper concerns lot-sizing in a multistage and multifacility pure distribution network. A facility at the end of the distribution network experiences a deterministic and continuous demand. Each facility has an echelon holding cost rate for each item it distributes, and a facility-dependent set up cost. In this paper an algorithm is presented of complexity 0(rd log r) where r is the number of end facilities and d is the maximum depth of the distribution system. The algorithm exploits a lower bound obtained by decomposing the distribution network into facilities-in-series problems. Using a set up cost allocation procedure, the maximum of the continuous solution of the decomposed problem is obtained. This maximizing solution provides the lower bound which is used for solving the distribution problem. This gives a power-of-two heuristic with a worst case performance no more than 2% above optimal.

In this paper we describe how simulating key aspects of an organization's structure, in this case a hospital, can yield insights into the design of information systems and their performance, In particular, we report on a project that simulates alternative distributed decision-making approaches for patient scheduling tasks. The results indicate that there are important and complicated interactions between the alternative organizational structures simulated, the form of the information systems supporting those structures, and the task environment. This suggests that current, universal, a priori assumptions about the interplay between technology and organizational structure are questionable. Furthermore, organization-specific simulation is seen as a potentially useful method of explicating the important tradeoffs in alternative design possibilities.

For an M(t)/G/infinity model with appropriate initial conditions, it is known that the number of busy servers at time t has a Poisson distribution for each t, so that the full distribution is characterized by its mean. Our formulas show how the peak congestion lags behind the peak arrival rate and how much less is the range of congestion than the range of offered load. The simple formulas can also be regarded as consequences of linear system theory, because the mean function can be regarded as the image of a linear operator applied to the arrival rate function. We also investigate the quality of various approximations for the mean number of busy servers such as the pointwise stationary approximation and several polynomial approximations. Finally, we apply the results for sinusoidal arrival rate functions to treat general periodic arrival rate functions using Fourier series. These results are intended to provide a better understanding of the behavior of the M(t)/G/infinty model and related M(t)/G/s/r models where some customers are lost or delayed.

We incorporate the impact of quality on lead time variance and on service reliability and demand. Quality costs are a joint and nonlinear function of various parameters of the manufacturing process. Our model shows that it may not be optimal for quality improvement efforts to target products that have the highest defective levels, largest direct costs or consume the maximum capital resources. A stochastic dynamic programming model is developed to evaluate the optimal trade-offs across prevention and appraisal costs and the costs of failure.

They isolate the current choice from future opportunities and neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating current plans. Overly cautious attitudes to risk result from a failure to appreciate the effects of statistical aggregation in mitigating relative risk. Overly optimistic forecasts result from the adoption of an inside view of the problem, which anchors predictions on plans and scenarios. The conflicting biases are documented in psychological research. Possible implications for decision making in organizations are examined.

J	UMANATH, NS; RAY, MR; CAMPBELL, TL				UMANATH, NS; RAY, MR; CAMPBELL, TL			THE IMPACT OF PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY AND PERCEIVED AGENT EFFECTIVENESS ON THE COMPOSITION OF COMPENSATION CONTRACTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COMPENSATION PLANS; AGENCY THEORY; MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; SALARY-INCENTIVE MIX	SALESFORCE COMPENSATION	Recently, a stream of theoretical development concerning the design of optimal compensation plans has emerged in the marketing literature. Little empirical work has been done so far to validate the theoretical predictions. The findings from the few field studies are equivocal and conflicting which we ascribe to failure to account for the major assumptions underlying the theoretical predictions. We argue that, in order to enhance the rigor of 'theory testing', the field studies must be complemented by laboratory experiments where the conditions stipulated by the assumptions of the theory can be systematically imposed and / or relaxed. This should help in the reconciliation of the differences found in the field studies. The experiment reported in this paper is a first step towards filling this void in the empirical research in this area. Here, we assess the impact of perceived environmental uncertainty and perceived agent effectiveness on the magnitude (total pay) and composition (salary-incentive mix) of employment compensation. The hypotheses stem from propositions analytically derived by Basu, Lal, Srinivasan, and Staelin (1985) and Lal and Srinivasan (1988). The insurance industry middle management compensation problem served as the experimental context. The results of the experiment ratified the hypothesis that an increase in perceived agent effectiveness leads to award of compensation contracts of larger total expected value and a larger proportion of performance-contingent pay However, the hypothesis that an increase in perceived environmental uncertainty prompts the principal to award compensation contracts of smaller total expected value and a smaller proportion of performance-contingent pay was rejected. We discuss possible alternative explanations for the conflicting results associated with the uncertainty variable and identify future research opportunities in this area.

While these firms might react differently, and in the case of the cooperative not unambiguously, to environmental change, neither variant will find the higher output-possibly more informative-option especially attractive.

The model describes production planning and distribution problems. Instead of solving the original multicommodity problem, we transform it so that a pair of single-commodity network flow problems can be solved. The original network is aggregated and the resulting problem is solved. Its solution determines a disaggregated problem that yields a feasible, near optimal solution to the original problem. We describe the determination of theoretical a priori and a posteriori bounds. We also introduce a very fight ''computational'' error bound. The implementation of the algorithm was tested against MPSX/370, and the specialized code for solving networks with side constraints NETSIDE. The proposed solution method was found to be much more efficient with negligible error.

The analysis is based on a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic that incorporates disease transmission and progression over time, behavioral changes, and effects of screening and associated counseling and education. The model allows one to consider not only effects on the screened women and their newborns, but also effects on the rest of the population. The analysis reveals that the primary benefit of screening programs targeted to women of childbearing age lies not in the prevention of HIV infection in their newborns but in the prevention of infection in their adult contacts. We find that screening medium and high risk women is likely to be cost-beneficial. Screening women regardless of risk group may also be cost-beneficial if screened positive women show relatively modest levels of behavioral change, but screening programs that reach primarily low risk women are not likely to be cost-beneficial. The results hold over a broad range of sensitivity analyses of important variables.

The algorithm produces a pair of policies whose value function is within a specified error of the solution to the fixed point equation. Part of the algorithm involves solving a set of fractional programs which are replaced by equivalent linear programs.

We analyze a two stage game, in which firms choose between a flexible and a less flexible technology in the first stage, then choose production quantities in the second stage. In equilibrium, a large proportion of FMS firms is associated with more concentrated markets. Our model predicts that a larger market and/or a more differentiated product results in a higher proportion of FMS firms being sustained. These predictions are empirically supported using cross-section industry level data from both the US and Japan.

The problem arises in the management of transportation companies In this paper some structural properties of the problem are studied and used to design a new polynomial-time heuristic algorithm which always guarantees the use of the minimum number of vehicles. Several effective refining procedures are also proposed. Extensive computational results on test problems involving up to 1,000 trips and 10 depots are reported, showing that the new approach always produces very tight approximate solutions in small computing times and outperforms other heuristics from the literature.

Under certain assumptions, including an equal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations, it is known that the optimal allocation of work is characterized by the ''bowl phenomenon'' whereby the interior stations (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (less work) over the end stations. The key question now being posed is: given an equal allocation of work to the respective stations, does the optimal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations follow an analogous pattern (the ''storage bowl phenomenon'') whereby the interior buffers (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (more space) over the end buffers? Because the decision variables now are discrete instead of continuous, the answer found in this study is: sometimes, but not in general. Characterizing the optimal allocation of storage space is a surprisingly subtle and complex problem. Despite the ambiguities, one dominant theme that runs throughout all of the results obtained is that, to the extent that preferential treatment in storage space allocations should be given, priority should be given to the interior buffers (especially the center ones) over the end buffers. The other key conclusion is that, when the total amount of storage space also is a decision variable, the overall optimal solution commonly follows a storage bowl phenomenon whereby the allocation of buffer storage space fits an inverted bowl pattern.

This paper examines a specific type of distributed work arrangement, supplemental work at home. This arrangement refers to full-time employees doing job-related work at home in the evenings and on weekends. Based on a theoretical analysis of supplemental work, data gathered from a 346 computer-owners and 104 nonowners are empirically examined. The results suggest that the amount of time spent on supplemental work is positively related to work self-determination variables (flexibility and control), portability of work tasks, the availability of a telecommunications link between the firm and the home, and household income, and negatively related to commuting time and the presence of children at home. The paper discusses the implications of supplemental work for organizational design and the employer-employee relationship. It concludes that compared to other types of work at home, supplemental work is one remote work arrangement that is likely to persist, especially for professionals and managers.

In recognition of this interest, this research adopts a commonly used conceptualization of risk and shows how this conceptualization leads to a new measure of risk, based upon the chance of loss of relative position within a set of firms. This framework is shown to be particularly appropriate for strategy research. Information contained in probability distributions describing the relative positions of sets of firms over time is shown to be partitionable on the basis of gain or loss in position as well as on firm identity, leading to the derivation of a new measure of strategic risk for an individual firm. This development also provides a hierarchical quantification of risk at the levels of the industry, group and individual firm. The ordinal risk measure is applied to both hypothetical data for illustration and to data on the U.S. airline industry.

Two systems of simultaneous nonlinear equations are formed, one from a general Lanchester model and one from a constrained model. Two empirical applications are conducted. In one involving Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, a formal statistical testing procedure is used to detect whether closed-loop equilibrium advertising strategies are used by the competitors rather than open-loop strategies. In the second application, involving Anheuser-Busch and Miller, the general model is estimated. Results indicate that closed-loop equilibria better explain dynamic advertising competition than do open-loop equilibria.

J	HO, CJ; LAU, HS				HO, CJ; LAU, HS			MINIMIZING TOTAL-COST IN SCHEDULING OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SCHEDULING; HEALTH CARE; SIMULATION		This paper considers various rules for scheduling appointments for medical clinic outpatients and investigates their ability to minimize a weighted sum of medical personnel's and patients' idle-time costs. it is shown that the idle times incurred by any given rule are affected by the following three ''environmental factors'' (in decreasing order of importance): the probability of no-show, the coefficient of variation of service times, and the number of patients per clinical session. Theoretically, an appropriate scheduling rule can be identified only if one knows the values of these parameters and the ratio between the medical personnel's and patients' idle-time costs. Under environments characterized by 27 different combinations of the three environmental factors, the performance of nine scheduling rules are evaluated using simulation. Some of the rules evaluated are original to this study. The results are presented in the form of ''efficient frontiers,'' together with a simple procedure for identifying the best scheduling rule for given environmental-parameter values. This rule-identification procedure is shown to be easily adaptable for circumstances with limited knowledge about the environmental factors; it also reveals that the simple Bailey-Welch individual-appointment rules are surprisingly robust.

Rather than construct designs based on the premise that the postulated model exactly represents the simulated response, as is the case in optimal design theory, we assume that the estimation process may be biased by the presence of unfitted third-order terms. We therefore seek to specify experimental plans that address the bias due to possible model misspecification as well as traditional variance considerations. The performance measure used for this ''fit-protect'' scenario is Box and Draper's design criterion of average mean squared error of predicted response. Four important classes of response surface experimental plans are examined: (1) central composite designs, (2) Box-Behnken plans, (3) three-level factorial experiments, and (4) small central composite designs. Each design class is studied in conjunction with three pseudorandom number assignment strategies; (1) the use of a unique set of streams at each design point; (2) the assignment of a common stream set to all experimental points; and (3) the simultaneous use of common and antithetic streams through design blocking. Comparisons of both design classes and assignment strategies are presented to assist the user in the selection of an appropriate experimental strategy.

We show that use of the open network model leads to a separable, convex formulation of the problem with relatively simple optimality conditions. Using these conditions, we prove in general that server groups with the same number of servers should be loaded equally and larger groups should be loaded more heavily than smaller groups. It is also shown that server pooling, combining servers into larger groups, will always reduce congestion and/or increase throughput. We discuss the significance of our results for job shop applications and also for the concept of a production bottleneck. In systems with an unbalanced configuration of servers, traditional, deterministic bottleneck analysis is distinctly nonoptimal; our results provide a simple way to locate production bottlenecks in shops with significant queueing effects.

J	DEMEULEMEESTER, E; HERROELEN, W				DEMEULEMEESTER, E; HERROELEN, W			A BRANCH-AND-BOUND PROCEDURE FOR THE MULTIPLE RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED PROJECT SCHEDULING PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS; PROGRAMMING BRANCH-AND-BOUND; NETWORKS GRAPHS APPLICATIONS	PERFORMANCE	In this paper a branch-and-bound procedure is described for scheduling the activities of a project of the PERT/CPM variety subject to precedence and resource constraints where the objective is to minimize project duration. The procedure is based on a depth-first solution strategy in which nodes in the solution tree represent resource and precedence feasible partial schedules. Branches emanating from a parent node correspond to exhaustive and minimal combinations of activities, the delay of which resolves resource conflicts at each parent node. Precedence and resource-based bounds described in the paper are combined with new dominance pruning rules to rapidly fathom major portions of the solution tree. The procedure is programmed in the C language for use on both a mainframe and a personal computer. The procedure has been validated using a standard set of test problems with between 7 and 50 activities requiring up to three resource types each. Computational experience on a personal computer indicates that the procedure is 11.6 times faster than the most rapid solution procedure reported in the literature while requiring less computer storage. Moreover, problems requiring large amounts of computer time using existing approaches for solving this problem type are rapidly solved with our procedure using the dominance rules described, resulting in a significant reduction in the variability in solution times as well.

It is shown that when portfolio rebalancing is allowed the CAPM holds in four cases not rigorously analyzed previously. These four cases are: (a) quadratic preferences; (b) one-period normal distributions when utility is defined on the multiperiod terminal wealth which is not nor-mal; (c) the terminal wealth is log-normally distributed; and (d) the terminal wealth W(T) is normally distributed, but in this case diverse holding periods are not allowed. Case d is similar to the Sharpe-Lintner model with the exception that T - 1 revisions are allowed.

J	CADSBY, CB				CADSBY, CB			THE CAPM AND THE CALENDAR - EMPIRICAL ANOMALIES AND THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STOCK MARKET ANOMALIES; CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL, JANUARY EFFECT, TURN-OF-MONTH EFFECT, DAY-OF-WEEK EFFECT, RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP	STOCK-MARKET SEASONALITY; OF-THE-YEAR; INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE; EQUILIBRIUM; PORTFOLIO; JANUARY; BIASES; TESTS	Tinic and West ( 1984) argue that a tradeoff between risk and return exists only in January. This study demonstrates that it is not just the January Effect on stock returns which is related to the measured risk-turn relationship and how that measure is apparently affected by the calendar. Other returns anomalies can also be paired with a conclusion about the relationship between risk and return. For example, risk appears to be rewarded at the turn of the month but not during the rest of the year and late in the week but not early in the week. This paper argues that, given the returns anomalies, the corresponding calendar effects on the risk-return relationship are consistent with the CAPM. Thus, the anomaly to be explained is not the relationship between risk and return focused on by Tinic and West (1984) but rather the calendar related variations in the returns themselves.

In each period the investor is faced with one or more risky investments. The maximization of the expected logarithm of the period by period wealth, referred to as the Kelly criterion, is a very desirable investment procedure' It has many attractive properties, such as maximizing the asymptotic rate of growth of the investor's fortune. On the other hand, instead of focusing on maximal growth, one can develop strategies based on maximum security. For example, one can minimize the ruin probability subject to making a positive return or compute a confidence level of increasing the investor's initial fortune to a given final wealth goal. This paper is concerned with methods to combine these two approaches. We derive computational formulas for a variety of growth and security measures. Utilizing fractional Kelly strategies, we can develop a complete tradeoff of growth versus security. The theory is applicable to favorable investment situations such as blackjack, horseracing, lotto games, index and commodity futures and options trading. The results provide insight into how one should properly invest in these situations.

J	TURNER, AL; WEIGEL, EJ				TURNER, AL; WEIGEL, EJ			DAILY STOCK-MARKET VOLATILITY - 1928-1989	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						VOLATILITY; EXTREME RETURNS; EVENT CLUSTERING	VARIANCE BOUNDS TESTS; CONDITIONAL HETEROSCEDASTICITY; PRICES; RETURNS; HETEROSKEDASTICITY; PERSISTENCE; VARIABILITY; EXCHANGE	This paper examines the daily return variability of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices over the 1928-1989 period. We use the traditional close-to-close standard deviation of returns, two alternative estimators incorporating the daily high and low of the index, and a robust estimator to measure the volatility of stock index returns. The 1980s were the third most volatile decade behind the 1920s and 30s. To a large extent, this was caused by the anomalous behavior of the fourth quarter of 1987. Returns in the 1980s had far more skewness and kurtosis than in any other decade studied; these results were not entirely due to 1987, as returns in 1988 and 1989 had large measures of both skewness and kurtosis. The frequency of extreme-return events increased in the 1980s, but was still dramatically less than the 1920s and 30s. When extreme negative days occurred in the 1980s the losses tended to be more severe than in the previous four decades. Extreme-return days are preceded by significant losses and are intertemporally clustered. There is no evidence of short-term market reversals after either positive or negative jumps in stock index returns.

We fit GARCH and EGARCH models to the stochastic volatility and briefly compare their performance to the CEV model. A hopscotch algorithm is used to value the warrants in the presence of the stochastic stock price volatility. The stochastic volatility-hopscotch warrant values still differ substantially from corresponding prices; in contrast, away-from-the-money short-term Nikkei 225 options valued with the same stochastic volatility models are close to observed prices.

Examples include: asset allocation for portfolio selection, international cash management, and programmed-trading arbitrage. Despite the large size of the resulting stochastic programs, the network structure can be exploited within the solution strategy giving rise to efficient implementations. Empirical results are presented indicating the benefits of the stochastic network approach for the asset allocation case.

This paper discusses the development of prepayment models for pools of fixed-rate mortgages. The models are complete: calibrated functional forms are given for all of the factors that determine prepayment rates. Hence, the models can be used as benchmarks against the simple models of the Public Securities Association, the Federal Housing Administration experience, or the variety of projected prepayment rates generated by proprietary industry models. The key factors that determine prepayment rates are: ( 1) refinancing incentive, (2) seasonal variations, (3) seasoning of the mortgage pool, and (4) burnout effect. Each factor is modeled separately and is calibrated using historical data. A multiplicative relationship determines the prepayment rate of the mortgage pool. A novel feature of our model is the use of basis functions that capture the complex interactions between the control variables, i.e., interest rate differentials and time, and the response parameter, i.e., prepayment rates.

An important assumption of the model is that the market consists of two types of consumers: "Loyals" and "Shoppers." The model provides estimates for: (1) the proportion of Loyals in a submarket, and (2) the success of each submarket in capturing Shoppers. We illustrate how the model can be used to characterize the competitive structure of a market. We also show how the estimated parameters of the model can be validated using simulation and a theoretically derived covariance matrix. Our empirical application to automobile data from J. D. Power and Associates provides insights into several interesting marketing phenomena including: (1) the competitiveness of domestic versus foreign makes of automobiles, (2) competition between submarkets defined by form, and (3) the effect of previous dealer experience on loyalty and shopping.

We developed a rule base to make annual extrapolation forecasts for economic and demographic time series. The development of the rule base drew upon protocol analyses of five experts on forecasting methods, This rule base, consisting of 99 rules, combined forecasts from four extrapolation methods (the random walk, regression, Brown's linear exponential smoothing, and Holt's exponential smoothing) according to rules using 18 features of time series. For one-year ahead ex ante forecasts of 90 annual series, the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) for rule-based forecasting was 13% less than that from equally-weighted combined forecasts. For six-year ahead ex ante forecasts, rule-based forecasting had a MdAPE that was 42% less. The improvement in accuracy of the rule-based forecasts over equally-weighted combined forecasts was statistically significant. Rule-based forecasting was more accurate than equal-weights combining in situations involving significant trends, low uncertainty, stability, and good domain expertise.

The effects of the number of batches and the number of control variates on the multivariate point and region estimators and the univariate point and interval estimators are considered. The results are experiment analysis guidelines in terms of an appropriate range of the number of batches to choose as a function of the number of responses and control variates.

J	FISHMAN, GS; KULKARNI, VG				FISHMAN, GS; KULKARNI, VG			IMPROVING MONTE-CARLO EFFICIENCY BY INCREASING VARIANCE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MONTE-CARLO; MARKOV CHAIN; SPANNING TREE; SAMPLING	RELIABILITY; BOUNDS	This paper compares the performances of two well-known Monte Carlo procedures for estimating an unknown quantity as the size of the problem grows. One method based on the standard Monte Carlo approach generates K i.i.d. data points. The other derives its data from a single K-step sample path generated by a Markov chain. The paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Markov chain approach to perform more efficiently than the standard Monte Carlo approach does. Moreover, it identifies circumstances under which this better efficiency grows with increasing problem size. This improved efficiency comes from reduced sample generating and function evaluating costs in the Markov chain approach that more than compensate for the increased variance of the estimator that the Markov chain sampling approach induces when compared to the standard Monte Carlo approach. Several examples illustrate how the benefits arise; one also demonstrates a case in which the standard Monte Carlo approach becomes increasingly preferred as the problem size grows.

J	HAMBRICK, DC; DAVENI, RA				HAMBRICK, DC; DAVENI, RA			TOP TEAM DETERIORATION AS PART OF THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF LARGE CORPORATE BANKRUPTCIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS; EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONAL DECLINE; BANKRUPTCY	ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR; STRATEGIC CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; DEMOGRAPHY; DIRECTORS; TURNOVER; DECLINE; BOARDS	This exploratory study of 57 large bankruptcies and 57 matched survivors examined the top management team (TMT) characteristics associated with major corporate failure. Prior research was used to guide selection of specific team characteristics for study. Not only did the failing firms show significant annual, or cross-sectional, divergence from survivors on several indicators of TMT composition, but also those divergences became more pronounced, even accelerating, over the last five years of the bankrupts' lives. The results thus suggest that deterioration of the top management team is a central element of the downward spiral of large corporate failures. Based upon a limited test of causality, the authors propose that a two-way process is at work: (1) team deficiencies bring about or aggravate corporate deterioration, either through strategic errors or stakeholder uneasiness with the flawed team; and (2) corporate deterioration brings about team deterioration, through a combination of voluntary departures, scapegoating, and limited resources for attracting new executive talent.

J	KARIMI, IA				KARIMI, IA			OPTIMAL CYCLE TIMES IN MULTISTAGE SERIAL SYSTEMS WITH SET-UP AND INVENTORY COSTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INVENTORY PRODUCTION, DETERMINISTIC MODELS; PRODUCTION SCHEDULING, FLOW SHOP; INVENTORY PRODUCTION, MULTISTAGE LOT SIZING		Scheduling of multistage serial production systems under constant demand and infinite horizon is considered. The production stages operate with periodic shut-downs and startups. An integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for determining a stationary, cyclic schedule with no stock-outs in any inventory and minimum sum of set-up and inventory costs, It allows a lot-sizing policy involving arbitrary, noninteger splitting/ merging of lots. Three, almost optimal, heuristic algorithms and an exact branch and bound algorithm are developed using analytical results. Their evaluation using simulated problems shows the branch and bound algorithm to be the best, as it is fast even for systems with as many as 11 stages.

We consider the case when three products are required to be produced in a given fixed lot size and at regular intervals. We derive a very simple test for existence of a feasible schedule and a method of constructing feasible schedules if one exists. The approach is simpler than the mixed integer programming approach and enumeration schemes currently proposed in the literature and is constructive.

The proposed methods integrate problem specific heuristics common to Operations Research and local search approaches from Artificial Intelligence in order to obtain desirable properties from both. The applicability of local search to a wide range of problems, and the incorporation of problem-specific information are both properties of the proposed algorithms. Two methods are proposed, both of which are based on novel definitions of solution spaces and of neighborhoods in these spaces. Applications of the proposed methodology are developed for job shop scheduling problems, and can be easily applied with any scheduling objective. To demonstrate effectiveness, the method is tested on the job shop scheduling problem with the minimum makespan objective. Encouraging results are obtained.

The server visits the nodes cyclically, serving the customers first at node 1, then at node 2, and so on through node n, and then repeating from node 1 again. Setup times are incurred when the server switches nodes. Typically, in the past, cyclic queues required that the work at any node arrive from the outside only. Our extension permits special nodes termed dual nodes. At these nodes the total work can include not only the outside customers, but also work transferred from other nodes. The transferred work is attended to as a batch at the dual nodes. Dual nodes permit a number of applications to be modeled including computer file transfer, rework in manufacturing, and internal mail delivery. If there are m dual nodes, the expected waiting time calculation requires solution of a linear system of size n(1 + m) + 2m or less.

Variation in conception probabilities across women reduces the usefulness of such an aggregate measure. More relevant is the conditional probability of achieving pregnancy on a given cycle following a number of failed IVF-ET attempts. We construct a model that accurately describes 1,257 treatment cycles performed at Yale over 571 different women. The model assumes a split population, where some women can never conceive via IVF-ET, while the remaining women have identical and constant per cycle probabilities of conception. This model produces estimates that are highly consistent with the data, and suggests that continuing treatment beyond some threshold number of cycles is not efficacious. Recognizing this, we determine cutoffs beyond which treatment should not continue for IVF-ET programs with fixed capacities. We also consider cutoff policies where program participants may belong to one of several different split populations, detailing the case of two groups. Finally, we show how one may reduce the average time in treatment (including waiting time) considerably with minimal impact on the probability of achieving pregnancy.

We use the Lanchester model of combat to represent the system dynamics that capture the competitive shifts due to investments in advertising by the two market rivals. We determine the equilibrium advertising levels using both closed- and open-loop policies. We also compare these equilibrium advertising policies for each firm to those obtained using an optimal control theory formulation wherein the advertising spending levels of the rival are assumed to be known. The empirical results obtained by analyzing the advertising rivalry between Coke and Pepsi for the period 1968-1981 under the above three alterative spending policies provide some interesting insights into the nature of competition between these two market rivals. A significant contribution of this paper is to extend the existing literature on advertising competition by integrating theoretical and empirical analyses.

We also give more precise definition to the concept of criticality of an activity, and introduce the new concept of flexibility of an activity which is akin to the traditional concept of activity floats in regular CPM, with the latter taking on different meaning from its common interpretation in standard CPM. Issues of optimization are raised when one assumes, for each activity, a piecewise-linear time-cost function that permits positive and negative deviations from its least-cost duration between specified lower and upper bounds on that duration. We seek the optimal activity durations subject to the specified GPRs and a given due date lambda. We also seek the construction of the complete project duration-cost function between the project minimum duration and its least-cost duration when the due date lambda is interpreted, first, as a "deadline" and, second, as a "target date" with rewards for early, and penalties for late completion. The relations between the problems posed and the uncapacitated minimum cost flow problems are revealed and are utilized in the algorithmic solution of the problems.

After controlling for unobserved firm-specific factors and the feedback between discretionary expenditures and profitability, our results suggest substantially lower accounting and stock market returns to R&D and advertising than indicated in previous research. Isolating mechanisms, which prevent imitation, do not appear sufficient for either R&D or advertising expenditures to generate, on the average, a long-run comparative advantage.

Using four different compensation schemes, we show that a necessary condition for reconciling divergent time preferences between principals and agents is a compensation scheme that induces behavior consistent with lower discount rates. Within subject results show that subjects recognize changes across compensation schemes and change their behavior as predicted by formal theory. Results also suggest that subjects become more myopic in their investment decisions if compensation contracts are incorrectly structured.

J	IYER, AV; SCHRAGE, LE				IYER, AV; SCHRAGE, LE			ANALYSIS OF THE DETERMINISTIC (S, S) INVENTORY PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INVENTORY; CONTROL; DISTRIBUTION; DETERMINISTIC		The traditional or textbook approach for finding an (s, S) inventory policy is to take a demand distribution as given and then find a reorder point s and order up to point S that are optimal for this demand distribution. In reality, the demand distribution may have been obtained by fitting it to some historical demand stream. In contrast, the deterministic (s, S) inventory problem is to directly determine the (s, S) pair that would have been optimal for the original demand stream, bypassing the distribution fitting step. The deterministic (s, S) inventory problem thus chooses parameters s and S which minimize setup, holding and backorder costs when the corresponding (s, S) policy is implemented over n periods with known demands d1, d2,...,d(n). Our contributions are two: (a) a polynomial time algorithm for finding an optimal (s, S) for the deterministic problem, and (b) an empirical comparison of the two approaches. In (b) we compare the long term average costs of the two approaches as a function of the amount of data available, distributional assumptions, and order lead time.

These features include: process shifting to out-of-control states, detection of the out-of-control shifts, corrective actions following the detections, and the fixed setup and variable processing times of reworks. The problem is motivated by the wafer probe operation in semiconductor manufacturing.

The plant has parallel production lines for processing multiple types of products. However, changeover cost and changeover time are incurred when a line changes from processing one type of products to a different type of products. We present a dynamic line allocation problem that determines an optimal line allocation so that the total relevant cost (changeover and waiting costs) is minimized. In this paper we analyze the complexity of the problem and develop three different heuristics for generating near-optimal allocations.

Emergency transshipments are used in these systems as a recourse action to reduce the occurrence of shortages. A class of partial pooling policies is proposed for the control of transshipments. The cost performance of this class of policies is shown to be inferior to that of complete pooling. An approximate model and a heuristic algorithm are introduced to compute near-optimal stocking policy solutions. Comparisons with simulation results verify the satisfactory performance of the approximate model and algorithm. Numerical sensitivity analysis provides additional insight into the nature of optimal transshipment behavior.

We investigate the robustness of traditional charts to data correlation when the correlation can be described by an ARMA (1,1) model. We compare the performance of the Shewhart chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart to the performance of the Special-Cause Control (SCC) chart and the Common-Cause Control (CCC) chart proposed by Alwan and Roberts (1988), which are designed to account for data correlation. We also explore the possibility of putting limits on the CCC chart, in order to predict quality abnormalities. The measure of performance used is the average run length (ARL). The results show that the ability of the EWMA chart to detect shifts in the process mean is quite robust to data correlation. while the corresponding individuals Shewhart chart rarely detects such shifts more quickly than the other charts. The SCC and CCC charts are shown to be preferred in most cases when a shift in the process mean exceeds 2 standard deviations. The experimental results can aid practitioners in deciding which chart would be most effective at detecting specified shifts in the process mean given the nature of their particular correlated environments. Two methodologies are utilized to explain the relative performance of the SPC charts compared: the dynamic step response function, and response surface methodology. Such methods not only facilitate a discussion of our results. but also make it possible to predict the relative performance of the charts when the process can be described by a model which is more complex than the ARMA (1,1) model.

The problem is formulated as one of optimal design of a single-server queueing system. in which the design variables are the service rate and the arrival rate (equivalently, the price charged for admission). The model is a variant of one introduced by Dewan and Mendelson, We allow for an upper bound on the arrival rate and consider slightly more general user value functions. We show that an optimal solution may not lie in the interior of the feasible region and thus may not be characterized by the first-order differential conditions. Moreover, the first-order conditions typically have several solutions, some of which may be relative minima and produce a negative value of the objective function (customer value minus the sum of expected delay cost and capacity cost per unit time). We also examine the stability of the equilibrium arrival rate and the convergence of a dynamic adaptive algorithm for finding the optimal service rate, in the context of a model in which the distribution of customers' value of service is uniform. We show that the equilibrium arrival rate is stable if and only if the service rate is above a threshold value, which depends on the price charged for admission and the parameters of the uniform distribution of value of service. The dynamic, adaptive algorithm always converges to a relative maximum of the objective function if the service rate can be adjusted every time the arrival rate changes.

A simple model with two competing exponential servers and Poisson arrivals is considered. Each server is free to choose his own service rate at a cost (per time unit) that is strictly convex and increasing. There is a fixed reward to a server for each customer that he serves. The model is designed to study one specific aspect of competition, namely, competition in speed of service as a means for capturing a larger market share in order to maximize long-run expected profit per time unit. A two-person strategic game is formulated and its solutions are characterized. Depending on the revenue per customer served and on the cost of maintaining service rates, the following three situations may arise: (i) a unique symmetric strategic (Nash) equilibrium in which expected waiting time is infinite; (ii) a unique symmetric strategic equilibrium in which expected waiting time is finite; and (iii) several, nonsymmetric strategic equilibria with infinite expected waiting time. An explicit expression for the market share of each server as a function of the service rates of the two servers is also given.

J	KLEIJNEN, JPC				KLEIJNEN, JPC			REGRESSION METAMODELS FOR SIMULATION WITH COMMON RANDOM NUMBERS - COMPARISON OF VALIDATION TESTS AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COMMON SEEDS; METAMODELING; SPECIFICATION ERROR; HOTELLINGS STATISTIC; EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN		Linear regression analysis is important in many fields. In the analysis of simulation results, a regression (meta) model can be applied, even when common pseudorandom numbers are used. To test the validity of the specified regression model, Rao (1959) generalized the F statistic for lack of fit, whereas Kleijnen (1983) proposed a cross-validation procedure using a Student's t statistic combined with Bonferroni's inequality. This paper reports on an extensive Monte Carlo experiment designed to compare these two methods. Under the normality assumption, cross-validation is conservative, whereas Rao's test realizes its nominal type I error and has high power. Robustness is investigated through lognormal and uniform distributions. When simulation responses are distributed lognormally, then cross-validation using Ordinary Least Squares is the only technique that has acceptable type I error. Uniform distributions give results similar to the normal case. Once the regression model is validated, confidence intervals for the individual regression parameters are computed. The Monte Carlo experiment compares several confidence interval procedures. Under normality, Rao's procedure is preferred since it has good coverage probability and acceptable half-length. Under lognormality, Ordinary Least Squares achieves nominal coverage probability. Uniform distributions again give results similar to the normal case.

J	GABA, A; WINKLER, RL				GABA, A; WINKLER, RL			IMPLICATIONS OF ERRORS IN SURVEY DATA - A BAYESIAN MODEL	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ERRORS IN SURVEY DATA; BAYESIAN INFERENCE; PURCHASE BEHAVIOR; MARKETING RESEARCH	PURCHASE	Data from surveys often include errors, and such errors can have a serious effect on inferences about behavior or perceptions. In this paper a model is developed for making inferences based on dichotomous survey data with possible errors. A likelihood analysis reveals an identification problem, which can be avoided when a Bayesian approach is taken. The model is illustrated with purchase recall data from two previous studies, and the analysis shows that errors can have a significant impact on inferences about behavior. Ignoring such errors leads to point estimates that are systematically too high in many cases and to interval estimates that are unrealistically narrow. The effective amount of information in the survey data is reduced dramatically by the presence of errors. These results have important implications for the use and value of survey data in marketing and in many other areas.

Using bank default data, the neural-net approach is compared with linear classifier, logistic regression, kNN, and ID3. Empirical results show that neural nets is a promising method of evaluating bank conditions in terms of predictive accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. Limitations of using neural nets as a general modeling tool are also discussed.

The results presented here rely on two different sets of properties of LP models: first, the syntactic relationships among indices that define the rows and columns of the LP, and second, the meanings attached to these indices. These two kinds of information allow us to build a complete algebraic statement of a model from a collection of components provided by the model builder.

This paper discusses eight different methods for representing linear programming models during the formulation phase. The approaches discussed are matrix generators, block-schematic and algebraic languages, three different kinds of graphical schemes, a database-oriented approach and Structured Modeling. While these eight approaches do not cover the entire spectrum of possible representation schemes, they are representative of past and current approaches to developing interfaces for large-scale linear programming systems. The different model representation schemes are compared using a common example and the transformations that allow one to change from one representation to another are discussed.

J	WESTLAND, JC				WESTLAND, JC			CONGESTION AND NETWORK EXTERNALITIES IN THE SHORT RUN PRICING OF INFORMATION-SYSTEM SERVICES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS; PRICING OF INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES; COORDINATION THEORY	COST ALLOCATION; PERFORMANCE; MARKETS	Transfer pricing provides management with an efficient tool for coordinating the use of information system services. In practice these services, if they are charged out to end users, are priced via an allocation of historical costs based on individual usage, or are assigned a price based on the fair market value of outside alteratives. Both approaches encourage suboptimal usage of information systems resources; they ignore three constituents of optimal transfer prices: (1) the reaction of other users to any change in a given user's consumption of service; (2) the technical response to additional use of an information system service, in the form of congestion and network externalities; and (3) end-user preferences for the information system service. Together, these influences on demand contribute to an externality. Two types of externalities are significant in information systems-congestion externalities decrease, and network externalities increase the utility of services. This research provides a complete model for computing optimal transfer price which corrects several existing problems in information system service valuation. When full absorption cost allocations contain significant fixed, precommitted or sunk cost components, it is not possible to balance the budget. Direct costing improves on full absorption costing, but mis-specifies costs when demand is nonlinear. To balance the budget with a minimum of disutility to end users management must resort to second-best pricing. Inefficiency arises from two sources when externalities are ignored in transfer pricing. End users cannot plan service usage, and thus encounter unanticipated congestion which lowers morale and efficiency, and increases costly expediting. Where congestion effects are highly nonlinear, congestion may effectively shut down the system. On the other hand, incorrect transfer prices can motivate usage too low to take advantage of network benefits. End users may confuse externality effects and intrinsic value of an information system service. In these cases, the price and performance of outside alteratives exert a complex and subtle influence on use and pricing of services. Where there exist identical outside and inside processing alteratives, and transfer pricing does not reflect this, there is a significant tendency to overprice and underutilize internal services. In this case there may be a tendency to outsource when processing should be kept in-house. Future markets for information systems will favor technologies which exhibit strong network externalities, and pricing of these technologies will become increasingly complex because of the interrelationship of hardware, software and data originated externalities. The models provided in this research will allow management to take advantage of these opportunities.		WESTLAND, JC (reprint author), UNIV SO CALIF,SCH BUSINESS ADM,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089, USA.

But individuals actually make decisions in bounded contexts called small worlds. Savage's axioms do not imply the optimality of maximizing expected utility in small worlds unless lotteries in different small worlds are probabilistically independent. Relaxing this independence assumption causes Savage's axioms to imply the optimality of maximizing a nonlinear utility model which includes, as special cases, the Chew weighted linear utility model, the Bell elation/disappointment model and the Allais mean/variance model in utility-independent small worlds.

J	WEIN, LM; CHEVALIER, PB				WEIN, LM; CHEVALIER, PB			A BROADER VIEW OF THE JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; QUEUING NETWORKS	DUE-DATES; RULES; PERFORMANCE	We define a job-shop scheduling problem with three dynamic decisions: assigning due-dates to exogenously arriving jobs, releasing jobs from a backlog to the shop floor, and sequencing jobs at each of two workstations in the shop. The job-shop is modeled as a multiclass queueing network and the objective is to minimize both the work-in-process (WIP) inventory on the shop floor and the due-date lead time (due-date minus arrival date) of jobs, subject to an upper bound constraint on the proportion of tardy jobs. A general two-step approach to this problem is proposed: (1) release and sequence jobs in order to minimize the WIP inventory subject to completing jobs at a specified rate, and (2) given the policies in (1), set due-dates that will attempt to minimize the due-date lead time, subject to the job tardiness constraint. A simulation study shows that this approach easily outperforms other combinations of traditional due-date setting, job release, and priority sequencing policies for two cases (moderately loaded and heavily loaded) of a particular shop. As a result of the study, three scheduling principles are proposed that can significantly improve the performance of a two-station job-shop; in particular, better due-date performance can be achieved by ignoring due-dates on the shop floor. Although we have only considered a two-station shop, the approach and scheduling principles presented here might also be useful for larger shops.

This bound is given by m(m + 1), where m is the EOQ's worth, i.e., the number of periods for which the total demand equals Economic Order Quantity. Our results do not require the solution of the infinite horizon problem to be unique. Nor do they require the infinite horizon problem to be well defined.

Among the foremost of these problems is the issue of improving the operational use of runways. The efficiency of runway usage is dictated primarily by the runway occupancy time (ROT) which is the time that an aircraft spends on the runway or its vicinity, until a new arrival or departure can be processed on this runway. This paper considers the problem of determining the geometry and location of high speed exits on a runway to minimize the weighted ROT of a population of aircraft under various landing scenarios and frequencies of usage. Both the problem of designing a new runway and modifying an existing one are addressed. It is shown that the continuous location problem of siting runway turnoffs admits a natural finite set of candidate optimal locations. To characterize problem data and determine optimal exit locations, a simulation program integrated with a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm is developed. The methodology has been implemented on a personal computer, and an example is presented to illustrate the approach.

This paper combines research on managerial control and team-member control in order to explore a range of control behaviors that can affect the performance of an I/S design team. Measures are developed and validated for managerial control and team-member control from both an outcome and a process perspective. Results from a study of 41 actual I/S design teams indicate that high-performing teams exhibit high process control by managers and high outcome control by team members. The results also support the proposition that both managerial and team-member control coexists and that increases in the total level of control behavior is positively correlated with performance.

J	AUSTER, ER				AUSTER, ER			THE RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRY EVOLUTION TO PATTERNS OF TECHNOLOGICAL LINKAGES, JOINT VENTURES, AND DIRECT-INVESTMENT BETWEEN UNITED-STATES AND JAPAN	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INTERORGANIZATIONAL LINKAGES, DIRECT INVESTMENT; INDUSTRY EVOLUTION; UNITED-STATES JAPAN	ENVIRONMENTS	Although economic activity between the U.S. and Japan has skyrocketed in the last decade, there are few large sample, cross-industry studies analyzing multiple forms of investment by the Japanese in the U.S. This study analyzes the key characteristics of each stage of industry evolution and the costs and benefits of each form of resource investment to predict the patterns of technological linkages, joint ventures, and direct investment of Japanese companies in the U.S. The results find support for a model predicting a predominance of technological linkages in emerging industries, joint ventures in growing industries, and direct investment in maturing industries. Technological linkages are most attractive in emerging industries as firms struggle to acquire technology, information and expertise and share cost and risk, yet retain flexibility. Joint ventures proliferate in growing industries because they offer a means of acquiring and expanding customer bases, yet reducing vulnerability. In maturing industries, where firms' key competencies are more developed, direct investment allows the company to generate demand in new markets without the disadvantage of joint governance.

J	SULLIVAN, MW				SULLIVAN, MW			BRAND EXTENSIONS - WHEN TO USE THEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING; BRAND EXTENSION; BRAND EQUITY; ORDER OF ENTRY	ADVANTAGES; STRATEGY; MARKETS	This empirical study investigates whether brand extensions should be introduced early or late in the life cycle of a product category. The longitudinal/cross-category sample of frequently purchased consumer brands is used to analyze how the performance of brand extensions depends on order of entry. The results indicate that early-entering brand extensions do not perform as well on average as either early-entering new-name products or late-entering brand extensions. This conclusion is based on four findings. First, the brand extensions were introduced later on average than the new-name products. Second, the early brand extensions had a lower probability of surviving than either the early-entering new-name products or the late-entering brand extensions. Third, the brand extensions earned higher market shares on average than new-name products, controlling for order of entry. Fourth, the extensions obtained smaller market share premia from entering early than did new-name products.

Further analysis reveals that the derived utility function for the return on the first gamble is discontinuous because gains or losses carry with them positive or negative signals regarding future prospects. A variant of the basic model without a discontinuity in derived utility has essentially the same implications. The issues raised in this paper present no conceptual difficulties for the standard expected utility theory; in principle, we can model the grand world and understand fully all implications of grand-world utility functions. In practice, however, this ideal may not always be attainable and as a result we may be faced with serious modeling and assessment problems.

The method assumes that a deterministic analysis has been completed using a weighted-additive multiattribute value (evaluation) function and that either an additive or multiplicative utility function is appropriate for the multiattribute utility analysis. An approximation procedure is developed to estimate whether uncertainty about attribute levels could change the deterministic evaluation results. An illustrative application investigates the accuracy of the procedure and its use to simplify analysis of the effects of uncertainty.

The bank matching book problem is to manage the term structures of assets and liabilities. In our first model, the bank borrows and lends only short run. In our second model, the bank borrows only short run but can lend short run and long run. The criterion in both models is the expected value of the present value of dividends issued. Both models yield dynamic programming problems. Broad aspects of optimal policies are indicated.

It has been demonstrated that expected utility is very closely approximated by an appropriate quadratic function. Recent studies have again questioned the empirical validity of mean-variance analysis. These efforts disregard the importance of the differences among various approximations, and historically, have focused on domestic financial securities. We re-examine the problem in the context of determining risk-efficient portfolios of production activities for subsistence farmers. The risks faced by these farmers are large and probably actuarially nonneutral. Thus, recommendations based on an inappropriate quadratic approximation could result in substantial losses in welfare.

In particular, a risk averse investor with any common utility function may, when choosing between two positive return opportunities, prefer the project simultaneously having a lower mean, higher variance, and lower positive skewness. Moreover, the decision maker can prefer opportunities with higher variance even when the opportunities are continuous, unimodal, and arbitrarily visually and statistically close to the normal distribution in shape. Our conclusions hold for any decision maker with a utility function whose derivatives alternate in sign being strictly positive or negative (i.e.. we exclude the uninteresting cases of quadratic and cubic utilities). The method of analysis is based upon the theory of Tchebychev systems of functions which deals with the expected value of [utility] functions of stochastic variables with known moments. Although we focus on the first three moments, the results, as presented here, apply to all higher moments as well. It is also shown that there can be extremely large deviations between the certainty equivalents of distributions having the same moments. so this result is also pertinent to practical decision analysts as well. The paper demonstrates that the properties of utility functions have implications which are much more subtle than previously recognized for evaluating distributions in terms of their moments.

J	COFFMAN, EG; GILBERT, EN				COFFMAN, EG; GILBERT, EN			SERVICE BY A QUEUE AND A CART	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						BATCH-SIZING PROBLEMS; PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; QUEUING SYSTEMS	TIMES	Items arrive randomly at a production facility that functions asa single-server queueing system. The items might represent parts, raw material, etc. and the server might be a factory worker or a machine in a production line. Following service, items are placed in a buffer where they are accumulated before delivery to a customer or some downstream activity in a production line. In practice, the buffer might be called a hopper; it may take the form of a cart or a pallet moved by a forklift. For simplicity the discussion here keeps with the cart terminology. The cart is delivered at times to be determined; during its absence the queue will in general grow by new arrivals. An item's average time in system, from arrival to delivery, is to be made small. The system must compromise between infrequent deliveries to avoid long delays in the queue and frequent deliveries to avoid long waits in the cart. This problem has a simple relation with standard batch-sizing problems in production scheduling. The cart delivery (batch-sizing) strategy considered here depends on two integers M and N. Delivery begins when N are in the cart or when the queue is empty and at least M are in the cart (M less-than-or-equal-to N). Items are assumed to arrive by a Poisson process, and their service times have a general distribution. Generating functions are derived which determine probability distributions for the numbers k in the cart, q in the queue, and k + q in the system. Numerical results are given for special cases M = N, N = infinity, and M = 0.		COFFMAN, EG (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS,MATH RES CTR,600 MT AVE,MURRAY HILL,NJ 07974, USA.						Coffman E. G.

J	GLASSERMAN, P; YAO, DD				GLASSERMAN, P; YAO, DD			SOME GUIDELINES AND GUARANTEES FOR COMMON RANDOM NUMBERS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SIMULATION; VARIANCE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES; STOCHASTIC ORDERING; COMMON RANDOM NUMBERS	SIMULATION; MARGINALS; NETWORKS	Common random numbers (CRN) is a widely-used technique for reducing variance in comparing stochastic systems through simulation. Its popularity derives from its intuitive appeal and ease of implementation. However, though CRN has been observed to work well with a broad range of models, the class of systems for which it is provably advantageous has remained rather limited. This paper has two purposes: We first discuss the effectiveness and optimality of CRN in a general setting, stressing the roles played by monotonicity and continuity properties. We then present specific, new classes of systems and comparisons for which CRN is beneficial and even optimal. Our conclusions for these systems are largely consistent with simulation practice and lend further theoretical support to folklore. Our results differ from those of previous analyses primarily because we put conditions on the timing of events, rather than the sequence of states, in a discrete-event simulation. We formulate our results in three settings corresponding to three applications of CRN: distributional comparisons, structural comparisons, and sensitivity analysis. In each case, we make use of conditions that simultaneously ensure monotonicity and continuity in the timing of events. These properties are established through explicit recursions for event epochs in terms of increasing, continuous functions.

J	HARTL, RF				HARTL, RF			OPTIMAL ACQUISITION OF POLLUTION-CONTROL EQUIPMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						OPTIMAL CONTROL; POLLUTION CONTROL		This paper considers a firm, which has to acquire a certain amount of pollution control equipment in order to comply with government pollution standards. Due to political battles and lobbying efforts, the compliance date and the date when it is announced are not known in advance. Furthermore, the target stock of pollution control equipment is also unknown. This amounts to an optimal control problem, in which the terminal time and the terminal state are random variables for which certain probability distributions can be estimated. The model explicitly considers technological progress in the production of abatement equipment, which leads to decreasing installation costs over time. Furthermore it is assumed that having a high stock of abatement equipment at early stages improves the firm's public image and thus its revenue. Tax deductions and other benefits for health conscious firms are also taken into account. Using optimal control theory the optimal investment in pollution control equipment is obtained, and the sensitivity with respect to discounting, wear out, technological progress and with respect to the parameters of the probability distributions is investigated.

This paper examines the formation of organizational goals, or aspiration levels, over time in groups of individuals representing top management teams of simulated organizations. The analysis compares the empirical validity of an adaptive attainment discrepancy model with models derived from rational and adaptive expectations theories. The results suggest that the attainment discrepancy model, which is based on a simple decision rule of adjustment to performance feedback, provides the most robust description of aspiration formation. They are also informative with regard to the application of expectation models to aspiration formation: There is a great deal of similarity between these results and those of prior studies on expectation formation. In addition, the study finds that there tends to be an optimistic bias in aspiration formation, that adaptation is not consistently incremental, and that adaptive learning may, over time, lead to behavioral outcomes that are consistent with rationality.

Benefit is measured as the additional expected life created, and empirically-estimated survivor functions for housing are used to calculate maximum costs at which renovation is cost-effective relative to new construction. Actual renovation costs for an existing program are compared with calculated maximums. Results suggest that past renovation practice may not have been cost-effective relative to new construction. Possible changes in program guidelines are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications.

Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that (i) conclusions drawn from FDE are dependent on the oscillation frequency and unless frequencies are chosen carefully, misleading results can be obtained; (ii) interpretation of results from frequency domain experiments are fundamentally different from the interpretation of results from regression analysis-specifically, a term found significant by FDE is not to be interpreted as a term able to explain a significant portion of the variation in the response over the experimental region; and (iii) basic assumptions required for FDE, in particular the assumption that input and output processes constitute a time-invariant linear system, do not hold for M/M/ 1 queues. Other issues discussed are indexing, run length determination, computational effort, and why FDE is not applicable for terminating simulations.

J	LOVEJOY, WS				LOVEJOY, WS			STOPPED MYOPIC POLICIES IN SOME INVENTORY MODELS WITH GENERALIZED DEMAND PROCESSES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INVENTORY POLICIES UNDER UNCERTAINTY; DEPENDENT DEMAND; APPROXIMATIONS; MARKOV MODELS; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING		This paper considers single-item inventory systems with immediate delivery and no economies of scale. Bounds are provided on the value loss relative to optimal cost for restricting attention to the class of inventory stocking policies that behave myopically up to a specified stopping time. The stopping time may be random, and may depend on demand histories as well as information exogenous to the firm. The bounds are robust to the nature of the demand process faced after the stopping time, so are applicable when the statistics of demand after the stopping time are unknown. Stopping times that are large with high probability imply that near-term decisions are completely specified with high probability. The general bounding results allow one to consider demand processes that may otherwise be analytically intractable. It is shown that the class of demand models for which the assumption of additive i.i.d. shocks is appropriate is the same class admitting effective myopic stocking policies. The bounds also make rigorous the intuitive notion that myopic policies are least effective in systems with precipitous drops in demand coupled with an inability to recover cash invested in inventory. The option of selling inventory at discount is a reality in many real systems and enhances the attractiveness of the myopic stocking policy. In numerical examples, the myopic policy is shown to be an effective competitor in a range of systems for which optimal policies are not known. The results suggest that for systems with immediate delivery, no economies of scale, and no currently known optimal policy, the myopic stocking rule is a reasonable default policy to adopt.

In a multiserver queue with unlimited waiting space, the appropriate server utilization typically increases as the number of servers (and the arrival rate) increases. We explain this economy of scale and give a rough quantitative characterization. We also show how increased variability in the arrival and service processes tends to reduce server utilization with a given grade of service. As part of this analysis, we develop simple approximations for the mean steady-state waiting time and the full steady-state waiting-time distribution. These approximations exploit an infinite-server approximation for the probability of delay and a single-server approximation for the conditional waiting-time distribution given that waiting occurs. The emphasis is on simple formulas that directly convey understanding.		WHITT, W (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS,MATH SCI RES CTR,DEPT MATH NETWORKS & SYST,MURRAY HILL,NJ 07974, USA.

The items have random yields and are used to satisfy the demands of many products. These products have specification requirements that overlap. An item originally targeted to satisfy the demand of one product may be used to satisfy the demand of other products when it conforms to their specifications. Customers' demand must be satisfied from inventory 100-alpha% of the time. We formulate the problem with service constraints and provide near-optimal solution to the problem with fixed planning horizon. We also propose simple heuristics for the problem solved with a rolling horizon. Some of the heuristics performed very well over a wide range of parameters.

Deriving of optimal policies, while computationally complex, nevertheless, is essential to provide insights about how effective migration policies for large systems should be structured. In this paper, analytic properties and performance of optimal file migration policies are investigated based on a Markov decision process model of file migration policies. Optimal migration policies are compared with optimal static policies and the sufficient conditions under which file migration provides absolute improvement or no advantage over static policies are presented. Numerical experiments and simulations were performed to analyze the impact of model assumptions and system parameters on the cost improvement generated by file migration. It is shown that optimal file migration is able to generate substantial cost improvement under certain conditions and that it is robust both with respect to the initial file allocation at an initial system design/reorganization point and to impreciseness of system environments. This analysis should provide system designers and administrators guidance toward achieving effective file migration control.

J	DANIELS, RL				DANIELS, RL			ANALYTICAL EVALUATION OF MULTICRITERIA HEURISTICS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MULTICRITERIA DECISION MAKING; HEURISTICS	BICRITERION SCHEDULING PROBLEM; SINGLE-MACHINE; PROCESSING TIMES; COST	This paper considers the problem of evaluating the solution quality of multi-criteria heuristics. By assuming an additive multi-attribute value structure, efficient and heuristic solutions can be translated into value measures that depend only on the relative importance assigned to the criteria of interest. Approximation errors are then defined as the value penalty incurred by approximating an efficient solution with its heuristic alternative. Results are derived which can be used to eliminate solutions that cannot represent the best available alterative among the set of efficient and heuristic solutions. For the bicriterion case, a polynomial algorithm for determining the mean and maximum relative heuristic error for a given problem instance is presented. For more general multi-criteria problems, the maximum relative approximation error can be determined by solving a series of linear programming problems.

With respect to R&D cooperation between firms, we show that the perception of high transaction cost is related to certain characteristics of the firm and to the type of R&D task. We also show a relationship between the perception of transaction cost and the perceived success of the cooperation. The analysis sheds light on various determinants of transaction costs.

Second, the paper extends well-known planning horizon results to this model using a novel dual-based approach, which also provides additional intuition. Finally, interesting computational results are provided that compare optimal and near-optimal forecast horizon values.

The problem is formulated first of all as a max-min problem, and then as an equivalent min-max problem. The min-max problem is easier to solve than the max-min problem. The information provided in solving the min-max problem may be used to facilitate the solution of the max-min problem.

An important first step in facility layout is the determination of which machines should be adjacent. This problem can be modelled as that of finding a maximum weight planar subgraph of a graph, given a measure of the desirability that two machines be adjacent based on the anticipated flows and technological constraints. We present a new heuristic that is a generalization of previous work of Foulds and Robinson. Preliminary computational results are presented which suggest that this heuristic performs well.

J	WHANG, SJ				WHANG, SJ			CONTRACTING FOR SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; CONTRACT DESIGN; INCENTIVES; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION	RELIANCE	Software contracting is a multi-faceted issue that involves legal, economic, managerial and technological considerations. To better understand the economic aspect of software contracting, this paper provides a summary review of software development contracts, followed by a game-theoretic model developed to incorporate incentive and information issues associated with software contracting. In the model an outside contractor is hired to develop a software system over multiple periods. Due to the uncertainties about costs or technology, the developer faces the risk of having to abandon the project at an intermediate phase. The user is better informed of the benefit of the system, while the developer privately discovers the development costs as the project advances. Given the limited information, the contracting parties make decisions in their own interest, leaving each party vulnerable to the other's opportunistic behavior. In this setting, we construct a viable contract that aligns the incentives of the contracting parties and produces the same equilibrium outcome as in in-house development. We also relate the implications of the model to the actual contract cases.		WHANG, SJ (reprint author), STANFORD UNIV,GRAD SCH BUSINESS,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.

J	GEOFFRION, AM				GEOFFRION, AM			INDEXING IN MODELING LANGUAGES FOR MATHEMATICAL-PROGRAMMING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MODELING LANGUAGE; MODELING SYSTEMS; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING; INDEXING STRUCTURES		Indexing structures are of fundamental importance to modeling languages for mathematical programming as a device for mathematical abstraction, and because they facilitate achieving conciseness, stability, and error-resistance. The aim of this article is to stimulate discussion of such structures, especially the two most common kinds found in algebriac style languages: sets and relations. We offer a taxonomy of set-based and relation-based indexing structures, a suite of detailed examples illustrating this taxonomy, and a number of specific principles (some arguable and some not) for incorporating indexing structures into modeling languages. We also examine four modeling languages in detail with respect to their indexing capabilities: AMPL, GAMS, LINGO, and SML. By attempting to work all of the illustrative examples in each language, we are able to reach some conclusions concerning relative expressive power, economy of notation, obedience to our principles of "good" language design, ease of data handling, and other criteria.

Demand is stationary and known, the technology exists to release two products simultaneously, and the seller can commit in advance to subsequent prices and qualities. Should he introduce two differentiated products at once or one at a time? Under the simultaneous strategy, the lower quality would cannibalize demand for the higher quality. To reduce cannibalization, the seller could lower the quality of the low-end model and reduce the price of the high-end. Alternatively, he could increase the quality of the low-end model, but delay its release. Sequential introduction, however, would mean that the profits from the low-end model arrive later. We show that sequential introduction is better than simultaneous introduction when cannibalization is a problem and customers are relatively more impatient than the seller. However, when the seller cannot pre-commit, sequential selling is much less attractive because then he cannot use his product designs to alleviate cannibalization.

J	GRIFFIN, A; HAUSER, JR				GRIFFIN, A; HAUSER, JR			PATTERNS OF COMMUNICATION AMONG MARKETING, ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING - A COMPARISON BETWEEN 2 NEW PRODUCT TEAMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COMMUNICATION; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MARKETING	R-AND-D; DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; COOPERATION; INFORMATION; INTERFACE; PERSONNEL; SERVICES; SUCCESS; QUALITY	Models and scientific evidence suggest that firms are more successful at new-product development if there is greater communication among marketing, engineering, and manufacturing. This paper examines communication patterns for two matched product-development teams where the key difference between the groups is that one used a phase-review development process and the other used Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a product-development process adopted recently at over 100 United States and Japanese firms. To our knowledge, this is the first head-to-head comparison of traditional U.S. product development processes with QFD. Our data suggest that QFD enhances communication levels within the core team (marketing, engineering, manufacturing). QFD changes communication patterns from "up-over-down" flows through management to more horizontal routes where core team members communicate directly with one another. On the other hand, the QFD team communicates less on planning information and less with members of the firm external to the team. If this paucity of external communication means that the team has the information it needs for product development, and the QFD process has provided an effective means for moving the information through the team, it is a positive impact of QFD. If the result means that QFD induces team insularity, even when the team needs to reach out to external information sources, it is a cause for concern.

The modeling of optimal behavior under such conditions is the subject of noncooperative game theory, of which a cornerstone is Harsanyi's formulation of games of incomplete information. In an incomplete-information game, uncertainty may surround the attributes as well as the strategic intentions of opposing players. Harsanyi develops the concept of a Bayesian equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium of a game in which the players' reciprocal beliefs about each others' attributes are consistent with a common prior distribution, as though they had been jointly drawn at random from populations with commonly-known proportions of types. The relation of such game-theoretic solution concepts to subjective probability theory and nonstrategic decision analysis has been controversial, as reflected in critiques by Kadane and Larkey and responses from Harsanyi, Shubil, and others, which have appeared in this journal. This paper shows that the Bayesian equilibrium concept and common prior assumption can be reconclied with a subjective view of probability by (i) supposing that players elicit each other's probabilities and utilities through the acceptance of gambles, and (ii) invoking a multi-agent extension of de Finetti's axiom of coherence (no arbitrage opportunities, a.k.a. "Dutch books"). However, the Nash property of statistical independence between players is weakened, and the probability distributions characterizing a solution of the game admit novel interpretations.

The comparison provides an efficient estimate of the error when approximating an f/f system with an infinity/infinity system and allows the analytical solution of the infinity/infinity model to be used as a control variate. We show that using infinity/infinity models as control variates for f/f systems can be an effective variance reduction technique for system performance estimates. Using these estimates will allow us to determine more efficiently when infinity/infinity models are good approximations for f/f systems.

We call this the method of parallel replications. This paper is concerned with using the method of parallel replications for estimating steady-state performance measures. We report on the results of queueing network simulation experiments that compare the statistical properties of several possible estimators that can be formed using this method. The theoretical asymptotic properties of these estimators were determined in Glynn and Heidelberger (1989a, b). Both the theory and the experimental results reported here strongly indicate that a nonstandard (in the context of steady-state simulation), yet easy to apply, estimation procedure is required on highly parallel machines. This nonstandard estimator is a ratio estimator. The experiments also show that use of the ratio estimator is advantageous even on machines with only a moderate degree of parallelism.

J	RABINOWITZ, G; MEHREZ, A; RABINA, A				RABINOWITZ, G; MEHREZ, A; RABINA, A			A NONLINEAR HEURISTIC SHORT-TERM MODEL FOR HYDROELECTRIC ENERGY-PRODUCTION - THE CASE OF THE HAZBANI-DAN WATER-SYSTEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						HYDROELECTRICITY; ENERGY; OPTIMAL CONTROL; WATER ALLOCATION	RESERVOIR	A two-stage decision and control model for the operation of the power station in the Hazbani-Dan Water System (Israel) was developed and implemented. In this system, river water is stored and then either consumed by agricultural farms or released to a hydroelectric power station. Under management policy, agricultural consumption is taken as a constraint. The problem was solved via a two-stage procedure consisting of a long-term model (LTM) and a short-term model (STM). The LTM was presented by Rabinowitz et al. (1988). This paper reports on the development and analysis of the STM, in which operational flexibilities of the power station are taken into consideration, thereby improving the LTM solution. Our main contributions are aimed at: (1) describing the (nontraditional) systematic thinking process which transformed the mathematically expressed problem into an efficiently solvable model; (2) presenting the analysis of the model; and (3) reporting on a practical application of the model in a unique system.

This study links various characteristics of actions with the total number and the time lag of competitors' responses. The hypothesized relationships were tested with a sample of competitive moves among U.S. airlines. The results suggested that responses are influenced by the characteristics of the actions that evoked them. Specifically, the total number of competitors affected by an action and the importance to these competitors of the markets under attack by the action increase the number of competitive responses. Strategic, as opposed to tactical, actions or actions which require substantial implementation efforts reduce the number and delay the timing of rivals' counteractions. Finally, contrary to prediction, competitors who have stake in the markets under attack by a competitive move react slowly.

The groups are based on 27 measured elements of corporate environment, corporate strategy, and formal and informal organization. Both product innovation and financial performance differ significantly over the groups, and a group of 42 firms that invest heavily in innovation perform best financially. A smaller group of firms that are not innovative but which follow a strategy of acquisition perform nearly as well financially. Firms focusing research resources on process innovation perform poorly, although process research complements product research among the effective innovators. Particularly important for explaining both product innovation and financial performance of these firms are salient combinations of classic elements of good environment, good strategy and good organization-strong positions in growing markets, investment in research and development, open and creative organizational structures and supportive organizational climates.

The application of that tool requires thinking in vector mode. This mode is examined in the context of Monte Carlo experiments with regression models; these regression models may serve as metamodels in simulation experiments. The vector mode needs to exploit a specific dimension of the Monte Carlo experiment, namely the replicates of that experiment. Taking advantage of the machine architecture gives a code that computes Ordinary Least Squares estimates on a Cyber 205 in only 2% of the time needed on a Vax 8700. For Generalized Least Squares estimates, however, the code runs slower on the Cyber 205 than on the VAX, if the regression model is small; for large models the CYBER 205 runs much faster.

J	LI, L				LI, L			THE ROLE OF INVENTORY IN DELIVERY-TIME COMPETITION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						INVENTORY PRODUCTION; CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; DELIVERY-TIME COMPETITION; STOCHASTIC OPTIMAL CONTROL; BARRIER POLICY; GAMES		The paper operationalizes the notion of shortage cost by considering the behavior of customers and competing firms and examines the role of inventory in response time competition. We start with a single-firm production control model in which custoemrs are characterized by their preferences of price, quality and delivery time. The optimal production/inventory policy and the optimal choice between make-to-order and make-to-stock operations are determined in simple "newsboy"-like formulas. The basic model is then extended to an n-firm market game in which firms compete for orders from the aspect of early delivery. One could think of this setting as an oligopoly racing market. The analysis shows that competition can breed a demand for produce-to-stock, just as other economic phenomena such as economies of scale, uncertainty, or seasonality can induce make-to-stock, and that delivery-time competition increases the buyer's welfare while decreasing the producer's welfare.

These distribution systems are characterized by the explicit inclusion of probabilistic elements. The probabilistic aspect considered is that only a subset of all potential customers needs service on any given working day. This subset of customers and their demand are determined according to some probability distribution. The cost of operating such systems is significantly affected by decisions on the number and locations of the distribution centers, the allocation of customers to each center, and the routing strategy. We propose a three-stage hierarchical approach in which decisions about the number of centers and their locations (first stage), customers allocations (second stage) and routing strategies (third stage) are combined to reduce total system cost.

Using the results from an experiment conducted with a strategic market simulation game, we find that the accessibility of information results in a disposition to focus on those components of decision-making most clearly addressed by the information. If these are not the components most closely tied to success, overall performance may in fact suffer. The decision-making process is thus "locally rational" since it may be optimal with respect to specific components of a larger plan, but globally suboptimal with regard to ultimate outcomes and for the organization as a whole. We describe the implications of the phenomenon for the use of market-related data in managerial decision-making.

We compare two different solution concepts for the matching assignment problem: the traditionally stable solution vs. a multiplicative utility approach that should avoid the bias. Simulation modeling leads us to conclude that: (1) With respect to all sizes compared in our experiment, applicants and employers groups were always treated far more equally under the multiplicative utility approach than the stable approach. (2) When using the stable algorithm, the size of the bias is affected by the size of the problem (i.e., the larger the problem size is, the larger the performance discrepancy between two groups of participants). Further analyses of the sensitivity of the finding to different assumptions (e.g., correlation in the preference orderings of the two groups, or use of nonlinear conversion from ranks to utilities) also resulted in a superior performance of the multiplicative utility algorithm in terms of a more equitable outcome.

The retailer is allowed to continuously vary the selling price of the product over the cycle. We introduce a notion of instantaneous margin, and use it to derive profit maximizing conditions for the retailer. The model explains the markdown of retail goods subject to decay. It also provides guidance in determining when price changes during the cycle are worthwile due to product aging, how often such changes should be made, and how such changes affect ordering intervals and quantities.

Several kinds of ceiling points are defined and analyzed and one kind called "feasible 1-ceiling points" proves to be of special interest. We demonstrate that all optimal solutions for a problem (P) whose feasible region is nonempty and bounded are feasible 1-ceiling points. Consequently, such a problem may be solved by enumerating just its feasible 1-ceiling points. The paper then describes an algorithm called the Heuristic Ceiling Point Algorithm (HCPA) which approximately solves (P) by searching only for feasible 1-ceiling points relatively near the optimal solution for the LP-relaxation; such solutions are apt to have a high (possibly even optimal) objective function value. The results of applying the HCPA to 48 test problems taken from the literature indicate that this approach usually yields a very good solution with a moderate amount of computational effort.

This problem is closely related to the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition technique used in large-scale convex programming. The proposed method is based on a column generation technique defining a sequence of primal linear programming maximization problems. Associated with each problem one defines a weighted potential function which is minimized using a variant of the projective algorithm. When a point close to the minimum of the potential function is reached, a corresponding point in the dual space is constructed, which is close to the analytic center of a polytope containing the solution set of the nondifferentiable optimization problem. An admissible cut of the polytope, corresponding to a new supporting hyperplane of the epigraph of the function of minimize, is then generated at this approximate analytic center. In the primal space this new cut translates into a new column for the associated linear programming problem. The algorithm has performed well on a set of convex nondifferentiable programming problems.

J	LIANG, TP				LIANG, TP			A COMPOSITE APPROACH TO INDUCING KNOWLEDGE FOR EXPERT SYSTEMS-DESIGN	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; RULE INDUCTION; EXPERT SYSTEMS; EMPIRICAL LEARNING	RULES	Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck for expert system design. One way to overcome this bottleneck is to induce expert system rules from sample data. This paper presents a new induction approach called CRIS. The key notion employed in CRIS is that nominal and nonnominal attributes have different characteristics and hence should be analyzed differently. In the beginning of the paper, the benefits of this approach are described. Next, the basic elements of the CRIS approach are discussed and illustrated. This is followed by a series of empirical comparisons of the predictive validity of CRIS versus two entropy-based induction methods (ACLS and PLSI), statistical discriminant analysis, and the backpropagation method in neural networks. These comparisons all indicate that CRIS has higher predictive validity. The implications of the findings for expert systems design are discussed in the conclusion of the paper.

J	HOFFMANN, TR				HOFFMANN, TR			EUREKA - A HYBRID SYSTEM FOR ASSEMBLY LINE BALANCING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						LINE BALANCING; BRANCH AND BOUND; MICROCOMPUTER; HEURISTIC	ALGORITHMS	Numerous methods have been proposed for solution of the simple assembly line balancing (SALB) problem. This paper describes a branch and bound algorithm which in many cases is faster than the well-known Hoffmann heuristic technique to which it is related. It introduces a simple bounding rule which uses the concept of the "theoretical" minimum slack time to achieve rapid solutions. It is combined with the Hoffmann heuristic to develop an even more effective system for solving SALB problems. Timing results are given for a standard set of problems found in the literature. Since that set was solved in such a very short time, more challenging as well as more typical problems are explored and timing results presented. Benchmarking of the procedure is easier since implementation is on an eight-megahertz IBM AT with a math coprocessor, using the standard IBM PC Professional FORTRAN compiler.

J	GERCHAK, Y; FULLER, JD				GERCHAK, Y; FULLER, JD			OPTIMAL VALUE DECLARATION IN BUY SELL SITUATIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; APPLICATIONS; BIDDING AUCTIONS		Buy-Sell "Shotgun" clauses call for a partner who wishes to discontinue a partnership to declare a value for the business, and for the other partner to then buy her out or sell to her at this value. The resulting decision model for an expected utility maximizing individual, who is uncertain of the business' valuation by the partner, is analyzed. This model is also applicable to a "divide and choose" fair division method, as well as some historical tax/customs schemes, and is more general than comparable bidding/auctions models. After showing that the optimal declaration is always between the declarer's valuation and the fractile of the subjective distribution corresponding to the share owned, we show that the optimal declaration is always increasing in the valuation, and for a risk-neutral declarer also increasing in the share owned. We prove that the more risk-averse the declarer, the closer is the optimal declaration to the valuation, and the higher the probability that the partner who values the business more will end up owning it. Finally, we relate the optimal declaration to the degree of uncertainty concerning the partner's valuation.

J	GROENEVELT, H; PINTELON, L; SEIDMANN, A				GROENEVELT, H; PINTELON, L; SEIDMANN, A			PRODUCTION LOT SIZING WITH MACHINE BREAKDOWNS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION PLANNING; LOT SIZING; MACHINE BREAKDOWNS	SIZE MODEL; INSPECTION; QUALITY	Economic lot sizing and batching models often assume reliable manufacturing facilities. In this research, we focus on the effects of machine breakdowns and corrective maintenance on the economic lot sizing decisions. Two production control policies are proposed for coping with these stochastic interferences. The first policy assumes that production of the interrupted lots is not resumed after a breakdown. Instead, the on-hand inventory is depleted before a new cycle is initiated. Under the second policy studied here, production is immediately resumed after a breakdown, if the current on-hand inventory is below a certain threshold level. It is shown that this control structure is optimal among all stationary policies. We show that under both policies the optimal lot sizes will always be bigger than the ones in a corresponding deterministic case, and that the optimal lot size increases with the failure rate. We also provide exact optimal and closed form approximate lot sizing formulas and derive tight bounds on the average cost per unit time for the approximations. In addition, we present various structural properties for these policies and operational insights relevant to such management decisions as machine replacement or maintenance schedules.

J	WEBSTER, S				WEBSTER, S			NEW BOUNDS FOR THE IDENTICAL PARALLEL PROCESSOR WEIGHTED FLOW TIME PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SCHEDULING; PARALLEL PROCESSORS; DETERMINISTIC; BOUNDS		In 1964, Eastman, Even, and Isaacs (EEI) presented a polynomial time lower bound for the NP-hard problem of scheduling n jobs on m available and identical processors to minimize weighted flow time. A general bound, of which the EEI bound is a special case, is proposed. Four new bounds for the identical processor problem are given. All of the new bounds can be applied to problems with variable processor ready times. The EEI bound is limited to problems where all processors are initially available at the same time. Two of the four new bounds are shown to dominate the EEI bound. The two other bounds are found to be effective for a particular problem class. Two polynomial time lower bounds for problems with nonidentical processors are introduced. One bound is applicable to the uniform processor problem; the other bound can be applied to the general processor problem. No bounds have previously been proposed for these problems.

Based on some theoretical and extensive empirical results, we propose two rules for ordering the stations. The first rule recommends arranging the two worst stations (according to our ordering) to the first and last stages. Numerical results show that this rule almost always agrees with the optimal ordering of stations. In cases where this rule does not agree with the optimal ordering, numerical results show that this rule leads to station arrangements that are near optimal. In addition, numerical results also indicate that the first rule is the most important one to achieve a near optimal throughput. The second rule arranges the remaining stations according to the so-called "bowl phenomenon." Numerical results illustrate that an optimal arrangement of stations need not exhibit the "bowl phenomenon," but the differences in the throughput between the optimal and the one obtained by the second rule are always very small (less than 0.5%).

We enrich this model by investigating the strategic pricing behavior of the incumbent when she operates in multiple markets. We demonstrate that the low-cost incumbent's ability to separate from a ghost high-cost type is enhanced when she combines her signalling effort across markets, instead of independent signalling in each market. we show that, in the combined least-cost signalling, the low-cost incumbent limit prices in each market. In an attempt to minimize dissipative but informative signalling costs, the low-cost incumbent may enter unprofitable markets, but exit after credible separation.

This solution is also an important first step in solving the multi-plant coordination problem. We consider a manufacturing facility with one critical raw material, and one or more products whose demand needs to be met. It is assumed that demand for finished goods and the arrival process for raw material are stochastic. We calculate simultaneously the optimal production level, and the raw material order quantity which minimize the total expected cost subject to capacity and release level constraints. The results obtained by our model (the integrated model) show that the production level should be no larger than the production level obtained by solving the traditional (nonintegrated) models, and that major savings are obtained by solving the integrated model. We are also able to characterize and evaluate the cost of reliable supplies of raw material. In addition we solve the above problem in the presence of capacity constraints. A procedure which allocates capacity to different products is presented.		BASSOK, Y (reprint author), CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV,GRAD SCH IND ADM,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213, USA.						Arrow K.

J	SCHERVISH, MJ; SEIDENFELD, T; KADANE, JB				SCHERVISH, MJ; SEIDENFELD, T; KADANE, JB			SHARED PREFERENCES AND STATE-DEPENDENT UTILITIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CONSENSUS; HORSE LOTTERIES; PRIZE-STATE LOTTERIES; SUBJECTIVE EXPECTED UTILITY		This investigation combines two questions for expected utility theory: 1. When do the shared preferences among expected utility maximizers conform to the dictates of expected utility? 2. What is the impact on expected utility theory of allowing preferences for prizes to be state-dependent? Our Principal conclusion (Theorem 4) establishes very restrictive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Pareto, Bayesian compromise of preferences between two Bayesian agents, even when utilities are permitted to be state-dependent and identifiable. This finding extends our earlier result (Theorem 2, 1989a) which applies provided that all utilities are state-independent. A subsidiary theme is a decision theoretic analysis of common rules for "pooling" expert probabilities. Against the backdrop of "horse lottery" theory (Anscombe and Aumann 1963) and subject to a weak Pareto rule, we show, generally, that there is no Bayesian compromise between two Bayesian agents even when state-dependent utilities are entertained in an identifiable way. The word "identifiable" is important because, if state-dependence is permitted merely by dropping the Anscombe-Aumann axiom (Axiom 4 here) for "state-independenoe," though a continuum of possible Bayesian compromises emerges, also it leads to an extreme underdetermination of an agent's personal probability and utility given the agent's preferences. Instead, when state-dependence is monitored through (our version of) the approach of Karni, Schmeidler, and Vind (1983), the general impossibility of a Bayesian, Pareto compromise in preferences reappears.

In many situations such as audit scheduling, the resources correspond to individuals (skilled labour). This naturally leads to an assignment type project scheduling problem, i.e. a project has to be processed by assigning one of several individuals (resources) to each job. In this paper we consider the nonpreemptive variant of a resource-constrained project job-assignment problem, where job durations as well as costs depend upon the assigned resource. Regarding precedence relations as well as release dates and deadlines, the question arises, to which jobs resources should be assigned in order to minimize overall costs. For solving this time-resource-cost-tradeoff problem we present a hybrid brand and bound/dynamic programming algorithm with a (rather efficient Monte Carlo type) heuristic upper bounding technique as well as various relaxation procedures for determining lower bounds. Computational results are presented as well.		DREXL, A (reprint author), UNIV KIEL, INST BETRIEBSWIRTSCHAFTSLEHRE, OLSHAUSENSTR 40, W-2300 KIEL 1, GERMANY.

Internal consistency was measured by the degree to which ordinal and cardinal or ratio responses agreed within the same weighting method. Convergent validity was measured by the degree of agreement between the weights elicited with different methods. External validity was determined by the degree to which weights elicited in this experiment agreed with weights that were elicited with managers of the Department of Energy. In terms of internal consistency, the tradeoff method fared worst. In terms of convergent validity, the pricing out method turned out to be an outlier. In terms of external validity, the pricing out method showed the best results. While the ratio and swing methods are quite consistent and show a fair amount of convergent validity, their external validity problems cast doubt on their usefulness. The main recommendation for applications is to improve the internal consistency of the tradeoff method by careful interactive elicitation and to use it in conjunction with the pricing out method to enhance its external validity.

J	RAY, SC				RAY, SC			RESOURCE-USE EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC-SCHOOLS - A STUDY OF CONNECTICUT DATA	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; NONDISCRETIONARY INPUTS; REGRESSION ANALYSIS	PRODUCTIVITY	This study combines Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with regression modelling to estimate relative efficiency in the public school districts of Connecticut. Factors affecting achievements are classified as school inputs and other socio-economic factors. DEA is performed with the school inputs only. Efficiency measures obtained from DEA are subsequently related to the socio-economic factors in a regression model with a one-sided disturbance term. The findings suggest that while productivity of school inputs varies considerably across districts this can be ascribed to a large extent to differences in the socio-economic background of the communities served. Variation in managerial efficiency is much less than what is implied by the DEA results.		RAY, SC (reprint author), UNIV CONNECTICUT,DEPT ECON,STORRS,CT 06268, USA.

J	LEI, L; WANG, TJ				LEI, L; WANG, TJ			THE MINIMUM COMMON-CYCLE ALGORITHM FOR CYCLIC SCHEDULING OF 2 MATERIAL HANDLING HOISTS WITH TIME WINDOW CONSTRAINTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CYCLIC SCHEDULING; HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS; HOISTS; TIME WINDOW CONSTRAINTS; PROBLEM PARTITIONING		The problem of cyclic scheduling of two hoists is defined as follows. There are N + 1 workstations, S0, S1, ..., S(N), and two identical hoists that move jobs between stations. Jobs are identical and each job has to visit all stations in the order that stations are numbered. It is assumed that the hoist traveling times between stations are given constants. Each station can hold one job at a time, and each job must remain at station S(i) for a period of at least a(i) and at most b(i) time units. Both a(i) and b(i), i = 2, ..., N, are given constants. Define mi, 0 less-than-or-equal-to i less-than-or-equal-to N, to be a move of a job from S(i) to S(i + 1). A cyclic schedule determines the order of N + 1 moves, {m(i), i = 0, 1, ..., N}, an assignment of these moves to hoists, and the start time of the moves in a cycle. The problem is to find a cyclic schedule that minimizes the total time (the cycle time) to complete all the N + 1 moves. Previous approaches toward solving cyclic hoist scheduling problems have been limited to single-hoist cases In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that finds schedules for systems with two hoists, and discuss an extension to the problem with more than two hoists. The algorithm uses a partitioning approach by which a system is partitioned into two sets of contiguous workstations and each hoist is assigned to a set. A sequence of alternative partitions is evaluated. For each partition, two single-hoist subproblems are formed and the optimal (minimal) cycle time for each subproblem is independently computed. The two optimal single-hoist schedules are then coupled and refined into a feasible two-hoist schedule with a common-cycle time for both hoists. The best of the generated schedules, that results in the minimum common-cycle time among the different partitions, is given as the final solution. Computational experience with both randomly generated problems and a benchmark problem arising from a real system is discussed.

Unfortunately closed form solutions for these options are rare and numerical methods can be computationally expensive. This article extends the literature on multinomial approximating models. Specifically, new multinomial models are presented that include as special cases existing models. The more general models are shown to be computationally more efficient.

J	MARCELLUS, RL; DADA, M				MARCELLUS, RL; DADA, M			INTERACTIVE PROCESS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION CONTROL; PROCESS IMPROVEMENT; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING	SYSTEMS	An ongoing production process produces defective parts at random intervals. Each defective part provides a learning opportunity which the decision maker may use to improve the process by investing resources to identify and remove the causes of the defective. For various cost criteria, it is optimal to invest in learning until the probability of producing a defective becomes sufficiently small. This policy has economic interpretations in terms of marginal benefits. In addition, the optimal policy for expected discounted present cost has an interpretation in terms of tradeoffs between "cost of failure" and "cost of prevention". The shape of the tradeoff curve gives insight into the controversy between the traditional and zero defects views towards cost of quality.

While the modeling literature focuses on one or the other, evidence from the field indicates that the two decisions are in fact interactive. In this paper, we develop and then apply an integrated model that solves the strategic issue of channel levels and the tactical issue of price rebates simultaneously.

This paper characterizes families of distributions which help keep tractable the analysis of such models. Our primary motivation is to provide guidance to practitioners in the selection of distributions: If a modeler feels that no member of the families we characterize is a reasonable approximation, then he will almost surely encounter serious analytic and computational problems if his data include censored observations. We characterize a family of distributions for which there exist fixed-dimensional sufficient statistics of purely censored observations. We also characterize an important subset of this family, appropriate for situations where data include both censored and exact observations. We derive the corresponding predictive distributions using arbitrary priors and present some general results relating stochastic dominance among predictive distributions to the parameters of the prior. We also analyze the cases of discrete and mixed random variables.		BRADEN, DJ (reprint author), UNIV ROCHESTER,WILLIAM E SIMON GRAD SCH BUSINESS ADM,ROCHESTER,NY 14627, USA.

This article summarizes some of those explanations, and shows that industry conditions and business strategies are likely to influence both risk and return. The relationships are depicted in a simultaneous model where business return, risk, and debt are endogenously determined. The model is tested with 132 nondiversified firms in 8 disparate industries. OLS estimates of the parameters of the model show the risk-return relationship to be significantly negative, as many past researchers have found. However, 3SLS estimates of the parameters of the simultaneous model reveal no significant relationship between risk and return. The tentative conclusion is that many of the studies in the line of research concerned with Bowman's (1980) paradox may have used an improperly specified model, and that when a more realistic simultaneous model is used, return and risk are shown to be influenced by various industry conditions and business strategies, but not by each other.

If the variance estimator is strongly consistent, fixed-width confidence interval construction is valid for large samples. It has long been known that the spectral variance estimator of steady-state simulation output analysis is consistent in the mean-square sense. Here, we provide strong consistency of this estimator, thereby justifying fixed-width confidence interval construction for the spectral method. A characterization of spectral density function estimators is also introduced. This characterization provides insight into the relation between spectral methods and overlapping batch means-type variance estimators. Finally, some of the mathematical conditions provide qualitative insight into the relation between the process correlation and certain parameters of spectral methods.

J	EASTON, FF; ROSSIN, DF				EASTON, FF; ROSSIN, DF			SUFFICIENT WORKING SUBSETS FOR THE TOUR SCHEDULING PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COLUMN GENERATION; STAFFING AND SCHEDULING; SERVICE OPERATIONS	SYSTEM; SHIFT	Mathematical programs to schedule service employees at minimum cost represent each feasible schedule, or tour, with an integer variable. In some service organizations, policies governing employee scheduling practices may permit millions of different tours. A common heuristic strategy is to reformulate the problem from a small working subset of the feasible tours. Solution quality depends on the number and types of schedules included in the model. This paper describes a working subset heuristic based on column generation. The method is general and can accommodate a mix of full- and part-time employees. Experiments revealed its formulations had objective values indistinguishable from those of models using all feasible tours, and significantly lower than those generated by alternative working subset procedures.

J	ELIASHBERG, J; STEINBERG, R				ELIASHBERG, J; STEINBERG, R			COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES FOR 2 FIRMS WITH ASYMMETRIC PRODUCTION COST STRUCTURES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION INVENTORY; MARKETING COMPETITIVE STRATEGY	PRICE-PRODUCTION DECISIONS; MODEL	We model joint production-marketing strategies for two firms with asymmetric production cost structures in competition. The first firm, called the "Production-smoother," faces a convex production cost and a linear inventory holding cost. The second firm, called the "Order-taker," faces a linear production cost and holds no inventory. Each firm is assumed to vary continuously over time both its production rate and its price in view of an unstable "surge" pattern of demand. The underlying theoretical motivation is to investigate the temporal nature of the equilibrium policies of two competing firms, one operating at or near capacity (the Production-smoother), and one operating significantly below capacity (the Order-taker). We characterize and compare the equilibrium strategies of the two competing firms. Among our results, we show that if the duopolistic Production-smoother finds it optimal to hold inventory, then he will begin the season by building up inventory, continue by drawing down inventory until it reaches zero, and conclude by following a "zero inventory" policy until the end of the season. This result, which is robust with respect to the market structure, is compared with a monopolistic Production-smoother policy. We also show that due to the "coupling" effect between the two competing firms, the time at which the Production-smoother begins his zero inventory policy is also critical for the Order-taker who divides his production and pricing strategies into two parts determined by the Production-smoother's zero inventory point. Numerical examples that illustrate certain aspects of our analyses are provided as well.

J	LIPPMAN, SA; MCCARDLE, KF				LIPPMAN, SA; MCCARDLE, KF			UNCERTAIN SEARCH - A MODEL OF SEARCH AMONG TECHNOLOGIES OF UNCERTAIN VALUES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SEARCH; SEQUENTIAL DECISION ANALYSIS; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING MODEL; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INNOVATION	JOB SEARCH; ADOPTION; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS	In the standard search problem there is an infinite pool of items whose distribution of values is known. A decision maker draws an item from the pool, observes its value, and decides whether to keep it or to draw another item. He can keep only one item, and he seeks the item with the largest value. In the standard uncertainty resolution problem there is only one item, and the value of that item remains uncertain even after it is drawn. The decision maker sequentially collects observations on the value of the item and decides whether to keep the item, discard the item, or take another observation. Uncertain search marries the sequential drawing from a pool of items from the search literature with the unknown value of a drawn item from the uncertainty resolution literature. Presented in the context of technology adoption, it considers drawing from a pool of new technologies whose values remain unknown even after being drawn. The decision maker sequentially purchases information in order to Bayesianly update the prior distribution of the technology's value. After each observation, the decision maker either adopts the technology (and hence quits searching), takes another costly observation, rejects the technology and quits searching, or rejects the technology and draws the next technology from the pool for observation. The solution to this uncertain search problem is surprisingly simple: solve the version of the uncertainty resolution problem in which the return to rejecting the technology is replaced by an exit value. Then use successive approximation to find a fixed point: an exit value that equals the expected value of the uncertainty resolution problem.

The seller's valuation is common knowledge, but the buyer's valuation is known only by the buyer. Impatience to reach an agreement comes from two sources: the traders discount future payoffs and there are transaction costs of bargaining. Equilibrium behavior involves either immediate trade, delayed trade, or immediate termination, depending on the size of the gains from trade and the relative bargaining costs. This contrasts with the pure discounting model where termination never occurs, and the pure transaction cost model where delayed trade never occurs.

J	SAMUELSON, WF				SAMUELSON, WF			FINAL-OFFER ARBITRATION UNDER INCOMPLETE INFORMATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ARBITRATION; GAME THEORY; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION	MODELS	In recent years, final-offer arbitration (FOA) has become an increasingly frequent means of resolving labor disputes in the private and public sectors. The present paper models FOA when each disputant has private information bearing on the true value of the case. The model characterizes the disputants' equilibrium offer behavior and examines arbitration performance. The main conclusion is that FOA outcomes are crudely responsive to the underlying merits of the case. In its favor, FOA can be expected to be less costly to administer than arbitration procedures that attempt to extract perfect information.

Problem restructuring can lead to changed perception of the issues by the parties, thus breaking deadlocks and increasing the parties' willingness to compromise. We present a framework and mechanisms for problem restructuring based on the goals and goal relationships of the negotiating parties as well as means of manipulating the parties' utility estimates. In addition, previous negotiations are a source of heuristic advice in the restructuring task. The restructuring approach has been implemented in the PERSUADER, a computer program that acts as a labor mediator in labor management disputes. To achieve its task, the PERSUADER negotiates separately with each party, company and union, to guide them in reaching agreement.

The theoretical framework of such models is presented by means of a rule-based formalism. This framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative models, and the use of multiple procedures for solving the negotiation problem, adjusting the solution, and restructuring the problem representation. A hypothetical example of a house purchase is given to illustrate the discussion. The implications of the study for future directions of research on negotiation modelling and support are presented.

We develop the evolutionary systems design (ESD) approach to restructuring involving a heuristic controls/goals/values referral process and other domain-independent methodological knowledge, such as constraint relaxation, contingency planning, coalition formation and flexible goal target. These ideas are applied to multiple problem restructuring in a scenario motivated by labor-management negotiations and buyout in the airline industry, in particular, a composite of negotiations at Eastern Airlines, TWA and UAL.

J	MUMPOWER, JL				MUMPOWER, JL			THE JUDGMENT POLICIES OF NEGOTIATORS AND THE STRUCTURE OF NEGOTIATION PROBLEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						NEGOTIATION; HUMAN JUDGMENT	CONFLICT; ARBITRATION	The structure of negotiation problems refers to characteristics of their feasible settlement spaces and efficient frontiers. These characteristics are determined by the joint distribution of negotiators' utilities across possible settlements. Variations in negotiators' judgment policies (i.e., how they judge the utility of potential settlements) may result in distinctly different negotiation problem structures. Depending on the structure of the negotiation problem, settlements that are efficient, maximize joint utility, and minimize inequality are sometimes possible, sometimes not. When such settlements are possible, different strategies may be necessary to reach them. They sometimes can be reached only by a "compromise" strategy in which the disputants split their differences on each issue, sometimes only by a "horsetrading" strategy involving trade-offs among extreme values on issues, sometimes by either, and sometimes by neither strategy. Settlements on the efficient frontier that yield equal utility to both negotiators will sometimes leave both relatively well satisfied, sometimes not. When equal-valued settlements yield low levels of utility, negotiators are likely to feel dissatisfied and may presume that the other negotiator must be comparatively better satisfied. Even seemingly simple negotiation problems often pose a high degree of cognitive complexity. In the face of uncertainty about the nature of the problem structure, negotiators may resort to simple bargaining tactics (e.g., incrementally offering concessions on the issue for which the marginal rate of loss of utility is least). For many commonly encountered problem structures, such tactics lead toward satisfactory settlements, but not always. Analyses of the judgment policies of negotiators and resultant negotiation problem structures will contribute to better understanding of negotiation processes and help to inform the design of negotiation support systems.

While much previous research in this area has focused on key analytical issues such as evaluating proposed options, much less research has addressed the equally important initial stage of negotiation: generating options for mutual gain. In general, groups do this poorly, as there are many obstacles that inhibit successful option generation. Recent advances in computer technology provide additional approaches that can be used to support option generation as one component in an overall Negotiation Support System. This paper presents an integrated series of laboratory and field studies that investigated various aspects of computer-supported option generation for groups that meet at the same place and time. The use of anonymity to separate personalities from the issues and promote more objective evaluation was found to improve option generation in some circumstances, particularly those with increased criticalness and/or power differences among the participants. Larger groups were found to be more effective than smaller groups, several smaller groups combined, and nominal groups.

The behavioral models that from the basis for this work were developed as part of RAND's Health Insurance Experiment, (HIE), a randomized clinical trial. The randomized design and statistical methods provided estimates of the effects of insurance on use, uncontaminated by sickness or selection effects. The demand for medical care was modelled using episodes of treatment. Within the simulation, episodes occur independently and randomly through time according to a Poisson process with rates depending on individual characteristics and insurance. Empirical results from the HIE indicate that insurance primarily affects individual decisions to seek treatment (episode frequency), but has only minimal effects on episode costs. The response to changes in price (insurance) is modelled as a Bernoulli censoring process on episode frequency. The model is used to address issues on the effective design of insurance plans.

The model also indicates that large firms have a greater incentive to cooperate because they are better positioned to capture the benefits of a research venture. These findings seem to explain why cooperative research among rival firms in Japan has been applied rather than basic and conducted frequently among large companies. But firms prefer as small a partner as possible to limit the sharing of research results, creating a tension that may make cooperative efforts among rivals difficult to manage. For this reason, cooperation with organizations, such as universities or nonprofit institutions, may be a viable alternative for firms looking for complementary skills and resources.

J	BENSON, PG; SARAPH, JV; SCHROEDER, RG				BENSON, PG; SARAPH, JV; SCHROEDER, RG			THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT ON QUALITY MANAGEMENT - AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						QUALITY MANAGEMENT; QUALITY CONTROL; EMPIRICAL RESEARCH		While the quality literature abounds with prescriptions for how quality should be managed, no one has proposed an organization-theory explanation for how quality is managed in organizations. This paper proposes a system-structural model of quality management that relates organizational quality context, actual quality management, ideal quality management, and quality performance. The relationships between organizational quality context and actual and ideal quality management are investigated using data collected from 152 managers from 77 business units of 20 manufacturing and service companies. A previously reported instrument is used to measure managers' perceptions of ideal and actual quality management in terms of eight critical factors including product/service design, training, employee relations, and top management leadership. Several measures are used to characterize organizational quality context including company type, company size, degree of competition, and corporate support for quality. The results indicate that organizational quality context influences managers' perceptions of both ideal and actual quality management. This suggests that knowledge of organizational quality context is useful for explaining and predicting quality management practice. Important contextual variables are corporate support for quality, past quality performance, managerial knowledge, and the extent of external quality demands.

The problem is of major interest to resellers of long distance services and corporate network managers who lease their lines from AT&T and Other Common Carriers. The algorithm can be used to select the most economical combination of lines to meet a desired grade of service, set here to an average blockage rate of 1% during the busy hour. Because of the nonlinearities involved, the problem is formulated as a dynamic program and solved with forward recursion. The Erlang loss formula is used to determine blockage in the case of Poisson arrivals, while Wilkinson's equivalent random theory is adopted when the input traffic is peaked. Model validation is achieved with a SLAM II simulation. The algorithm is applied to the network of National Telecommunications of Austin, which consists of 5 hierarchical levels and 52 candidate nodes, and carries about 2.3 million minutes of monthly traffic. Current services range from FX connections to Specialized WATS. The results indicate that cost reductions of over 18%, or $30,000 per month, can be achieved by periodically adjusting trunk group sizes to match the forecast demand.

J	LIEBERMAN, ER				LIEBERMAN, ER			SOVIET MULTIOBJECTIVE MATHEMATICAL-PROGRAMMING METHODS - AN OVERVIEW	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PROGRAMMING-MULTIPLE CRITERIA; MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES; USSR	OPTIMIZATION	Over the past 20-30 years multi-objective mathematical programming (MOMP) has emerged as an increasingly active area of research in the fields of management science, operations research, applied mathematics, and engineering. Despite the intensity of interest, however, earlier surveys of MOMP methods have all but ignored Soviet work in this area. Published in unfamiliar journals and often available only in Russian, the Soviet research has remained virtually unknown outside of the USSR and Eastern Europe. This has been particularly unfortunate given the extent, importance, and originality of much of the Soviet research. The current article attempts to correct this situation by providing a comprehensive, yet nontechnical, overview of Soviet MOMP methods. Using a taxonomy similar to ones that have been applied to Western MOMP techniques, the article categorizes the Soviet methods based on when they involve a decision maker in the solution process-a priori, progressively, a posteriori, or never-and what kind of information the decision maker provides. In all, 17 methods are analyzed with particular attention given to their distinctive features and to the issues of computational feasibility and burden on the decision maker. The article concludes with observations on the overall character of Soviet MOMP research, comparing the general directions in Soviet and Western research.

J	PORTEUS, EL; WHANG, S				PORTEUS, EL; WHANG, S			ON MANUFACTURING MARKETING INCENTIVES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MANUFACTURING MARKETING INCENTIVES; AGENCY THEORY; HIDDEN EFFORT; NEWSVENDOR MODEL; DELEGATION; FUTURES MARKET; FRANCHISING	MORAL HAZARD; INFORMATION	Stereotypically, marketing is mainly concerned about satisfying customers and manufacturing is mainly interested in factory efficiency. Using the principal-agent (agency) paradigm, which assumes that the marketing and manufacturing managers of the firm will act in their self-interest, we seek incentive plans that will induce those managers to act so that the owner of the firm can attain as much as possible of the residual returns. One optimal incentive plan can be interpreted as follows: The owner subcontracts to pay the manufacturing manager a fixed rate for all capacity he delivers. Each marketing manager receives all of the returns from his product. In turn, all managers pay a fixed fee to the owner. Under this plan, the marketing managers will often complain about the stock level decisions, even though these levels are announced in advance. Under a revised plan, the owner can eliminate such complaints by delegating the stocking decisions to the respective marketing managers, without any loss. This plan is interpreted as requiring the owner to make a futures market for manufacturing capacity, paying the manufacturing manager the expected marginal value for each unit of capacity delivered, receiving the realized marginal value from the marketing managers, and losing money on average in the process.

Its ability to calculate the standard deviations of order statistics reveals the uncertainty of the critical estimates of the tails of cumulative density functions. Understanding this uncertainty reveals why a wide variety of tail shapes all cause a notable loss in power for stochastic dominance tests. Simulations show that the smoothing inherent in bootstrapping can significantly increase the power of the tests when dominance exists in the population.

Let n denote the number of periods into which the planning horizon is divided. We describe a simple forward algorithm which solves the general model in 0(n log n) time and 0(n) space, as opposed to the well-known shortest path algorithm advocated over the last 30 years with 0(n2) time. A linear, i.e., 0(n)-time and space algorithm is obtained for two important special cases: (a) models without speculative motives for carrying stock, i.e., where in each interval of time the per unit order cost increases by less than the cost of carrying a unit in stock; (b) models with non-decreasing setup costs. We also derive conditions for the existence of monotone optimal policies and relate these to known (planning horizon and other) results from the literature.

However, knowledge of their effects is sparse, particularly for difficult situations such as group conflict. This study reports a laboratory experiment to examine how a general purpose group decision support system (GDSS) influenced conflict management in small groups making a budget allocation decision. The study tests a model that posits that GDSS impacts on conflict outcomes are mediated by group interaction processes, particularly how the GDSS enters into group interaction. The model posits seven potential impacts-some positive and some negative-that GDSS technology might have on conflict interaction processes. The impacts do not automatically occur, but depend on the nature of the GDSS and how the group applies it. Hence, a given GDSS might result only in a subset of the seven impacts. Among other things, the model predicts that the particular combination of GDSS impacts that materializes differs across groups and that the balance of these impacts, positive or negative, determines positive or negative conflict outcomes. Groups using a particular GDSS, the Software Aided Meeting Management (SAMM) system, were compared to groups using a manual version of the same decision structures built into SAMM and to unsupported groups. Results indicated that there were differences in the level of conflict in SAMM-supported versus manually-supported and unsupported groups, and in conflict management behaviors adopted by the different conditions. Moreover, there were differences in the impacts of SAMM for different groups, and there is some evidence that these contributed to consensus change. Overall, the theoretical model was supported by the study. This model and approach used in this study seem useful for designing future studies concerning the impacts of computer technology on group judgement and choice.

J	MONTGOMERY, CA; WERNERFELT, B				MONTGOMERY, CA; WERNERFELT, B			SOURCES OF SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE - MARKET SHARE VERSUS INDUSTRY EFFECTS IN THE UNITED-STATES BREWING INDUSTRY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FIRM RESOURCES; PERFORMANCE; MARKET SHARE	COMMON-STOCKS; TOBIN-Q; RETURNS; MODEL; FIRM	Using financial measures of performance we investigate the sources of value creation in the U.S. brewing industry between 1969 and 1979. We find that market share gains in this industry at this time are not correlated with changes in value and that the performance of individual leading firms is highly correlated. Our interpretation is that the success of market share building strategies depends critically on specific industry conditions. Specifically, in the absence of fundamental shifts in the relative resource positions of individual firms, share gains may come at too high a price. In addition, the research shows that intra-industry correlations in returns may result from excessive competition rather than collusion.

The system is microcomputer-based and uses menus and graphically displayed zip code maps of IRS districts for interactive inputs and solution outputs. The mathematical model used for this problem is the uncapacitated, fixed charge, location-allocation model which minimizes travel and facility costs, given a specified level of activity. A greedy-interchange heuristic is used to obtain "good" solutions to the problem and is coupled with a lagrangian-relaxation technique providing a measure of how far from optimality the current solution can be. An example with Florida data illustrates the use of the model.

The analysis allows an investor to examine how parametric changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints affect the composition, mean, and variance of the optimal portfolio. The optimal portfolio and associated multipliers are piecewise linear functions of the changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints. The parametric parts of the solution show the rates of substitution of securities in the optimal portfolio, while the parametric parts of the multipliers show the rates at which constraints are either tightening or loosening. Furthermore, the parametric parts of the solution and multipliers change in different intervals when constraints become active or inactive. The optimal MV paths for sensitivity analyses are piecewise parabolic, as in traditional MV analysis.

In this paper, we provide a modelling framework for project management activities, that ultimately accounts for expected worker behavior under Parkinson's Law. A stochastic activity completion time model is used to formally state Parkinson's Law. The developed model helps to examine the effects of information release policies on subcontractors of project activities, and to develop managerial policies for setting appropriate deadlines for series or parallel project activities.

J	WEIN, LM; OU, JH				WEIN, LM; OU, JH			THE IMPACT OF PROCESSING TIME KNOWLEDGE ON DYNAMIC JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; QUEUING NETWORKS		The goal of this paper is to determine if the results for dynamic job-shop scheduling problems are affected by the assumptions made with regard to the processing time distributions and the scheduler's knowledge of the processing times. Three dynamic job-shop scheduling problems (including a two-station version of Conway et al.'s 1967 nine-station symmetric shop) are tested under seven different scenarios, one deterministic and six stochastic, using computer simulation. The deterministic scenario, where the processing times are exponential and observed by the scheduler, has been considered in many simulation studies, including Conway et al.'s. The six stochastic scenarios include the case where the processing times are exponential and only the mean is known by the scheduler, and five different cases where the machines are subject to unpredictable failures. Two policies were tested, the shortest expected processing time (SEPT) rule, and a rule derived from a Brownian analysis of the corresponding queueing network scheduling problem. Although the SEPT rule performed well in the deterministic scenario, it was easily outperformed by the Brownian policies in the six stochastic scenarios for all three problems. Thus, the results from simulation studies of dynamic, deterministic job-shop scheduling problems may not carry over to the more realistic setting where there is unpredictable variability.

J	SPEARMAN, ML				SPEARMAN, ML			AN ANALYTIC CONGESTION MODEL FOR CLOSED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS WITH IFR PROCESSING TIMES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						QUEUES APPROXIMATIONS, CYCLIC, APPLICATIONS; INVENTORY PRODUCTION PULL SYSTEMS	QUEUING-NETWORKS; COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS; QUEUES	We present an analytic model relating the mean cycle time or throughput as a function of the number of jobs in a closed production system composed of a tandem network of queues having exponential and/or IFR processing times. This model exhibits macroscopic behavior that is predicted by results from queueing theory and involves three meaningful parameters: the bottleneck rate and the "raw process" time that can be determined from first moment data; and a dimensionless congestion coefficient that is typically obtained from a single WIP/average cycle time observation (e.g., simulation). The derivation of the model is based on observations of the behavior of the relation between mean cycle time and WIP. This "engineering" approach is different from a purely "probabilistic" one in that we do not consider the distribution of processing times at individual station. We compare the accuracy of the model in predicting mean cycle times to other techniques such as mean value analysis and simulation.

This paper discusses nonadditive models that use the hierarchical structure in order to examine issues of tradeoffs that models in present use are not able to include. The models are sufficiently structured so that they can be applied by procedures that are similar to those available for other prescriptive models of preferences.

In recent years, even greater flexibility has been achieved by flexible manufacturing systems, where groups of NC machines are linked by automated material handling devices and controlled by computer. In such shops, a batch of product may have several possible alternative routes that it may follow through the shop. A number of researchers have shown that determining the proper mix of routes for each product can have a significant effect on shop throughput and work-in-process inventory. Other researchers have found that the lot sizing decision also affects these performance measures. The primary thrust of this paper is to develop a model to explore the interaction between routing and lot sizing decisions in a multi-machine, multi-work center job shop. A heuristic is developed for simultaneously determining lot sizes and routing mix in problems of practical size, and numerical examples are provided in order to illustrate the solution method. The examples show that there can be considerable potential for performance improvement by simultaneous consideration of routing and lot sizing.

It is not addressed to the disutility of various numbers of fatalities that might occur, but rather to how fatalities are distributed over the groups. Although dispersive equity has long been recognized as an important component of some policy decisions, it has received little formal treatment within the matrix of salient factors for such decisions. Our purpose is to advance its formal development. This is done within a formulation based on probability distributions over potential fatality sets. The formulation gives rise to four distinct but not independent equity concepts: individual risk equity, group risk equity, dispersive equity, and social outcome equity. Each of these is analyzed, but special attention is given to dispersive equity. The paper also comments on relationships between total equity and its four components, and between total equity and the disutility of various numbers of fatalities.

We begin by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the behavioral violations of the respective normative theories for the two domains (i.e., expected utility and discounted utility models). We argue that such violations (or preference reversals) are broadly consistent with three propositions about the weight that an attribute receives in both types of multiattribute choice. Specifically, it appears that: (1) if we add a constant to all values of an attribute, then that attribute becomes less important; (2) if we proportionately increase all values of an attribute, or if we change the sign of an attribute, from positive to negative, then that attribute becomes more important. The generality of these propositions, as well as the constraints they would impose on separable representations of multiattribute preferences, is discussed.

Therefore, capacity expansion models need to take into account uncertainty. This uncertainty may arise because of errors in the specification, statistical estimation of relationships and in the assumptions of exogenous variables. One such example is demand uncertainty. In this paper, a cautious capacity planning approach is described for solving problems in which robustness to likely errors is needed. The aim is to cast the problem in a deterministic framework and thereby avoid the complexities inherent in nonlinear stochastic formulations. We adopt a robust approach and minimize an augmented objective function that penalises the sensitivity of the objective function to various types of uncertainty. The robust or sensitivity approach is compared with Friedenfelds' equivalent deterministic demand method. Using numerical results from a large nonlinear programming capacity planning model, it is shown that as caution against demand uncertainty increases, the variance of the total objective function (profit) decreases. The cost of such robustness is a deterioration in the deterministic risky performance. This method is also applied to an industry simulation model in order to assess the effect of uncertainty in market demand on optimal capacity expansion and capacity utilisation.

DLSP relates to capacitated lotsizing as well as to job scheduling problems and is concerned with determining a feasible production schedule with minimal total costs in a single-stage manufacturing process. This involves the sequencing and sizing of production lots for a number of different items over a discrete and finite planning horizon. Feasibility of production schedules is subject to production quantities being within bounds set by capacity. A problem classification for DLSP is introduced and results on computational complexity are derived for a number of single and parallel machine problems. Furthermore, efficient algorithms are discussed for solving special single and parallel machine variants of DLSP.

J	SRINIVASAN, MM; LEE, HS				SRINIVASAN, MM; LEE, HS			RANDOM REVIEW PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEMS WITH COMPOUND POISSON DEMANDS AND ARBITRARY PROCESSING TIMES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEMS; CONTROL POLICIES; (S,S) INVENTORY MODELS	POLICIES; SERVER; QUEUE	A production/inventory system is considered in which a single production facility produces items of a given type. The demand for the item is assumed to arrive according to a compound Poisson process. The time required to produce an item is assumed to follow an arbitrary distribution. An (s, S) policy is considered in which production stops at the instant that the inventory level is raised to S and production resumes at an inspection point when the inventory level is observed to have dropped to or below s for the first time. The time interval between two successive inspection points during a nonproduction period is a random variable which follows an arbitrary distribution. Under a cost structure which includes a set-up cost, a linear holding cost and a linear backorder cost, an expression for the expected cost per unit time is obtained for given control values. The operating cost during a cycle is shown to be convex in S for a given value of S-s. For the continuous review simple Poisson demand system, as well as some other special cases of the system considered here, it is shown that the expected cost per unit time is unimodal. Based on these properties, a procedure to find the optimal (s, S) policy is presented.

J	WEIN, LM				WEIN, LM			DUE-DATE SETTING AND PRIORITY SEQUENCING IN A MULTICLASS M/G/1 QUEUE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; QUEUES	JOB-SHOP; RULES; TRANSFORM	The problem of simultaneous due-date setting and priority sequencing is analyzed in the setting of a multiclass M/G/1 queueing system. The objective is to minimize the weighted average due-date lead time (due-date minus arrival date) of jobs subject to a constraint on either the fraction of tardy jobs or the average job tardiness. Several parametric and nonparametric due-date setting policies are proposed that depend on the class of arriving job, the state of the queueing system at the time of the job's arrival, and the sequencing policy (the weighted shortest expected processing time rule) that is used. In a simulation experiment performed on a two-class M/M/1 system, these policies outperformed traditional due-date setting policies, and due-date setting had a larger impact on performance than priority sequencing.

We demonstrate the general application of materialized views, and define the concept of materialized view currency and allow a query to specify its currency requirement. We also allow a materialized view to be updated from either a base relation or another materialized view. This flexibility provides an opportunity for further reduction in the cost of maintaining distributed materialized views. We model the problem of optimal update policies to capture currency and policy constraints, replicated data, and various view update policies. The optimization incorporates a minimum-cost objective function as well as user's response time constraints.

J	ORAL, M; KETTANI, O; LANG, P				ORAL, M; KETTANI, O; LANG, P			A METHODOLOGY FOR COLLECTIVE EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION; GROUP DECISION MAKING; IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SOCIAL CHOICE; MULTIPLE CRITERIA ANALYSIS; CONSENSUS FORMATION	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; EFFICIENCY; RANKING; CHOICE; MODELS	This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating and selecting R&D projects in a collective decision setting, especially useful at sectorial and national levels. It consists of two major phases: Evaluation and Selection. The evaluation process repeately uses mathematical programming models to determine the "relative values" of a given R&D project from the viewpoint of the other R&D projects. The selection process of R&D projects is based on these "relative values" and is done through a model-based outranking method. The salient features of the methodology developed are its ability to (1) permit the evaluation of an R&D project from the viewpoint of the other R&D projects without at first imposing a uniform evaluation scheme, and (2) maximize the level of consensus as to which projects should not be retained in the R&D Program being funded, thus minimizing the level of possible resentment in those organizations or departments whose projects are not included in the R&D Program. Also discussed in this paper is an application of the methodology to evaluate and select major R&D projects in the iron and steel industry of Turkey.

J	POWERS, K; HANSSENS, DM; HSER, YI; ANGLIN, MD				POWERS, K; HANSSENS, DM; HSER, YI; ANGLIN, MD			MEASURING THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF PUBLIC-POLICY - THE CASE OF NARCOTICS USE AND PROPERTY CRIME	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; ESTIMATORS	The effects of treatment and legal supervision on narcotics use and criminal activities were assessed by applying newly developed time-series methods that disentangle the long-term (permanent) and the short-term (temporary) effects of intervention. A multivariate systems approach was used to characterize the dynamic interplay of several related behaviors at a group level over a long period of time. Five variables-abstinence from narcotics use, daily narcotics use (or addiction), property crime, methadone maintenance treatment, and legal supervision-were derived by aggregating information from over 600 narcotic addiction histories averaging 12 years in length. Because of the long assessment period, age was also included as a control variable. Overall, the system dynamics among the variables were characterized by long-term rather than short-term relationships. Neither methadone maintenance nor legal supervision had short-term effects on narcotics use or property crime. Methadone maintenance treatment demonstrated long-term benefits by reducing narcotics use and criminal activities. Legal supervision, on the other hand, did not reduce either narcotics use or property crime in the long run. Instead, there was a positive long-term relationship in which a higher level of legal supervision was related to higher levels of narcotics use and criminal activity. This latter finding is consistent with the observation that either narcotics use or criminal activity is likely to bring addicts to the attention of the legal system. However, these addicts, as a group, did not directly respond to legal supervision by changing their narcotics use or crime involvement except perhaps through coerced treatment. The paper explores the policy implications of these findings.

J	WHITT, W				WHITT, W			THE EFFICIENCY OF ONE LONG-RUN VERSUS INDEPENDENT REPLICATIONS IN STEADY-STATE SIMULATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSIENT; LENGTH; OUTPUT; BIAS	We evaluate the efficiency of one long run versus independent replications in steady-state discrete-event simulation, assuming that an initial portion of each replication will be deleted to allow the process to approach steady state. We provide supporting evidence in favor of one long run, but we also show that multiple replications can be more efficient. The advantage of one long run increases if the amount deleted increases or if the covariance function decreases more quickly (assuming it is nonnegative and decreasing). Thus, assuming that the amount deleted depends on the way the process approaches steady state, one long run tends to be efficient when the covariance function decays rapidly compared to the rate the process approaches steady state. We also discuss ways to determine the initial portion to delete. We consider the case of an exponential covariance function in detail, and use it as a basis for approximations. We also consider the M/G/infinity queueing model and reflected Brownian motion, the latter as an approximation for the G/G/1 queueing model. For these models starting at the origin, one long run is efficient, but a moderate number of independent replications is essentially equally efficient. In agreement with Kelton and Law (1984), for such examples our analysis only rules out many replications of very short runs.

J	SRINIVASAN, MM				SRINIVASAN, MM			NONDETERMINISTIC POLLING SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							CYCLIC-SERVICE SYSTEMS; WAITING-TIMES; APPROXIMATIONS; ORDER	A nondeterministic polling system is considered in which a single server serves a number of stations. The service discipline at each station is, consistently, either nonexhaustive, semiexhaustive, gated, or exhaustive. If the server polls a station i which uses either the nonexhaustive or the semiexhaustive service discipline, then the next station polled is station j with probability p(ij) if there was service at station i. The service time at station i is a random variable which may depend on the station polled next. If no service is performed at station i, then the next station polled is station j with probability e(ij). The time to switch between stations i and j is a random variable which may depend on whether service was performed at station i or not. If the server polls a station i that follows either the exhaustive service discipline or the gated service discipline, then the next station polled is station j with probability p(ij) regardless of whether there was service at station i or not. Cycle times and stability conditions are derived for this system, and Conservation Laws are obtained which express a weighted sum of the mean waiting times in terms of known data parameters. For systems with a mix of exhaustive and gated service stations, we show how the individual mean waiting times can be obtained.

J	MONTREUIL, B; VENKATADRI, U				MONTREUIL, B; VENKATADRI, U			STRATEGIC INTERPOLATIVE DESIGN OF DYNAMIC MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS LAYOUTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							FACILITY LAYOUT; PLANT LAYOUT	This paper presents a proactive strategic methodology for designing dynamic layouts for the expansion (or decline) phase of manufacturing systems. The methodology first estimates probable scenarios of the system requirements at its maturity level, strategically designs mature layouts given the set of scenarios, then tactically interpolates intermediate layouts, backward to the initial facilities plan. For manufacturing systems with rigid facilities, the paper provides a linear programming model sustaining this proactive strategic methodology. The model efficiently generates optimal layouts for all intermediate expansion phases given a goal layout for the final mature phase of the expansion plan, the phased cell sets, the phased flow and relationships sets, and various design constraints, for an array of objectives.

J	GAVISH, B; PIRKUL, H				GAVISH, B; PIRKUL, H			ALGORITHMS FOR THE MULTI-RESOURCE GENERALIZED ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							ONE KNAPSACK-PROBLEMS; DATABASE LOCATION; COMPUTER; NETWORKS; SYSTEM	The multi-resource generalized assignment problem is encountered when a set of tasks have to be assigned to a set of agents in a way that permits assignment of multiple tasks to an agent subject to the availability of a set of multiple resources consumed by that agent. This problem differs from the generalized assignment problem in that an agent consumes not just one but a variety of resources in performing the tasks assigned to him. This paper develops effective solution procedures for the multi-resource generalized assignment problem. Various relaxations of the problem are studied and theoretical relations among these relaxations are pointed out. Rules for reducing problem size are discussed and are shown to be effective through computational experiments. Heuristic solution procedures and an efficient branch and bound procedure are developed. Results of computational experiments testing these procedures are reported.

J	GORDON, KJ; GORDON, RF; KUROSE, JF; MACNAIR, EA				GORDON, KJ; GORDON, RF; KUROSE, JF; MACNAIR, EA			AN EXTENSIBLE VISUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF HIERARCHICALLY-STRUCTURED MODELS OF RESOURCE CONTENTION SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							SIMULATION; SOFTWARE	The development of models for evaluating the performance of resource contention systems, such as manufacturing systems, computer systems, and communication networks, is often a difficult and complex task. This modeling effort can be dramatically reduced by the use of appropriate software tools. The Research Queueing Package Modeling Environment (RESQME) provides a graphical environment for constructing, solving, and analyzing the results of extended queueing network models of resource contention systems. It supports a rich underlying modeling paradigm previously developed in the Research Queueing Package (RESQ) and provides a single integrated graphical interface throughout all tasks of the modeling lifecycle. In this paper we present a brief overview of RESQME and then focus on two of its most important features: the construction and analysis of hierarchically-structured models and the ability to extend and customize the RESQME environment for domain-specific modeling via the use of user-defined modeling elements. A manufacturing model is developed in order to illustrate these capabilities.

J	ALI, AI; COOK, WD; SEIFORD, LM				ALI, AI; COOK, WD; SEIFORD, LM			STRICT VS WEAK ORDINAL RELATIONS FOR MULTIPLIERS IN DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING UNITS; EFFICIENCY	In a recent paper, Golany (1988) proposes an interesting extension of Data Envelopment Analysis to the situation where ordinal relations among weights corresponding to certain dimensions exist. However, the development of the extended model contains mathematical errors and the proposed equivalence is incorrect. We establish the correct model equivalence and prove that weak ordinal relations require a nonstandard DEA model. We also show that the case of strict ordinal relations can be handled with the standard DEA model. These results hold for the CCR, BCC, additive, and multiplicative models and for relations involving both input and output multipliers.

In particular, the L1 risk model leads to a linear program instead of a quadratic program, so that a large-scale optimization problem consisting of more than 1,000 stocks may be solved on a real time basis. Numerical experiments using the historical data of NIKKEI 225 stocks show that the L1 risk model generates a portfolio quite similar to that of the Markowitz's model within a fraction of time required to solve the latter.

The study shows that firms which diversify into unrelated areas of business devote a larger proportion of their capital investments to acquisitions and are, therefore, characterized by smaller differences between replacement-cost and historical-cost values of assets than undiversified firms. The implications of these findings, as well as other operating characteristics of diversified firms, for the following areas of accounting research are subsequently examined. (1) Inflation-adjusted data. Inflation-adjusted data of diversified firms have less incremental information content (beyond historical-cost) than those of undiversified firms. (2) Earnings Response Coefficients. Diversified firms have stronger market associations with earnings changes, and their earnings are more persistent. (3) Selection of accounting methods. Diversified firms select, ceteris paribus, more liberal accounting methods than their undiversified counterparts.

The individuals all share a common prior distribution for theta and a common loss function, but form their posterior distributions based on different data sets. A single distribution of theta must be chosen by combining the individual posterior distributions in some type of opinion pool. In this paper, the optimal pool is presented when the data observed by the different members of the group are conditionally independent given theta. When the data are not conditionally independent, the optimal weights to be used in a linear opinion pool are determined for problems involving quadratic loss functions and arbitrary distributions for theta and the data. Properties of the optimal procedure are developed and some examples are discussed.

In this paper we show how to identify the form of an optimal solution of such a game by a graphical procedure. By means of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, we illustrate how Wilson's algorithm can be enhanced using the derived analytic form of the solution to produce an explicit optimal strategy. We can then determine not only how P1 should play on all subsequent moves of the game, but also use ideas of Bayes rationality to discuss whether a given model of P2's reactions is realistic.

These problems arise frequently in the automotive industry. One job must be launched into the system at equal time intervals, where the time interval (or cycle time) is prespecified. The problem is to sequence the jobs to maximize the total amount of work completed, or equivalently, to minimize the total amount of incomplete work (or work overload). Since there is a large number of option combinations, each job is almost unique. This fact precludes the use of existing mixed model assembly line sequencing techniques. We first consider the sequencing problem for a single station which can perform two different sets of operations. We characterize the optimal solution for this problem and use the results as the basis for a heuristic procedure for multiple stations. Computational results with data from a major automobile company are reported.

A single crame is used to move all the Work-in-Process (WIP) in the system. The overall system objective is to maximize the yield rate subject to the flow time limit of the WIP. We formalize the problem, and analytically and empirically show that cyclic scheduling provides a near optimal solution, which is superior to dispatching rules. First, we illustrate the optimality and benefits of cyclic scheduling in a simple environment. Then, for multiple-product problems, we show that for a given sequence, finding the minimum cycle time becomes the maximum cost circular network flow problem in a graph. Based on the insights developed, a heuristic for sequencing product types in a cycle is derived that approximately minimizes the cycle time over all sequences. Finally, computational experiments are reported and various assertions made in the paper are empirically verified.

J	KEEFER, DL				KEEFER, DL			RESOURCE-ALLOCATION MODELS WITH RISK-AVERSION AND PROBABILISTIC DEPENDENCE - OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS BIDDING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							DECISION-ANALYSIS; WINNERS CURSE; AUCTIONS; INFORMATION	Bidding for offshore U.S. oil and gas leases is a major corporate resource allocation problem involving enormous uncertainties and very high stakes. This paper presents two new, operationally useful decision analysis models to aid in bidding for oil and gas leases. They are unique in that they consider risk aversion and probabilistic dependence among the values of the leases, with both bid levels and partnership shares as (continuous) decision variables. They are suitable for use in evaluating proposed bidding policies or as objective functions in optimization formulations. Practicality of their data requirements is evidenced by use of one of the models for several years in a major oil company. Comparison of optimal solutions to these models on a small example, using actual oil-company data, demonstrates the importance of taking risk aversion and probabilistic dependence into account, and provides insight into the adequacy of independence and conditional dependence as approximations for dependence. These results are pertinent to other real-world allocation problems that share many of the characteristics of bidding problems, such as R&D funds allocation.

SEU with suspicion, therefore, explains at least as many empirical violations of SEU theory as do these and similar models. We give examples to illustrate how several important types of SEU violations may seem to arise when suspicion is present.

J	CAMPBELL, GM; MABERT, VA				CAMPBELL, GM; MABERT, VA			CYCLICAL SCHEDULES FOR CAPACITATED LOT SIZING WITH DYNAMIC DEMANDS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article								Cyclical scheduling, where the time between production periods for each item is constant, offers simplicity and ease of control compared with noncyclical scheduling, where production periods are irregularly spaced. However, when demands are dynamic, flexibility in the spacing of production periods permits noncyclical scheduling to result in lower total costs. This study investigates the additional cost of cyclical scheduling. We focus upon the capacitated lot sizing problem (CLSP), which deals with planning production on a single, capacitated machine serving multiple items with dynamic demands. To establish cyclical schedules, a mathematical programming model is developed along with a heuristic solution technique and a Lagrangian-based lower bounding procedure. For problems solved in this study, differences between solution costs and lower bounds average less than 1%. Experiments are performed to evaluate the heuristic technique and to compare cyclical schedules with noncyclical ones. For comparison purposes, a noncyclical heuristic and problem sets from the literature are used. New problems based upon operating data from Ford Motor Company are also generated and solved. In this study, cyclical schedules average 4.4% higher in cost than, noncyclical ones. Coefficient of demand variation most seriously influences differences in costs. Other significant factors include capacity utilization, setup time, time between orders, and number of items.

Economics are achieved if these savings outweigh the increase in ordering costs. In this paper we analyze dual sourcing in the context of the "reorder point, order quantity" inventory model with constant demand and stochastic lead times and compare it with single sourcing. Two cases are studied, using the uniform and the exponential distributions, which may be thought of as two extreme ways of representing stochastic lead times. In our two-vendor model, the order quantity is split equally between the two vendors and the split orders are placed simultaneously when the inventory position reaches the reorder level. A comparison of the total expected costs suggests that when the uncertainty in the lead times is high and the ordering costs are low, dual sourcing could be cost effective.

J	SARKAR, D; ZANGWILL, WI				SARKAR, D; ZANGWILL, WI			VARIANCE EFFECTS IN CYCLIC PRODUCTION SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							MODELS	Utilizing a cyclic queue system, this paper investigates the effect of variance on a multi-item production facility. The variance of setup time, service rate and arrival rate is shown to have a powerful and sometimes paradoxical influence. Reduction in setup time, for example, is usually presumed to reduce inventory. We demonstrate that inventory can blow up if setup time is cut. Another paradoxical effect of variance is on processing rate. Speeding up the processing rate should reduce the material waiting to be processed. Again we show that the opposite can hold. Other properties of variance are examined, such as its relationship to KAIZEN and Just-In-Time production practices, and especially its property of impairing capacity.

J	SCHWEITZER, PJ; SEIDMANN, A				SCHWEITZER, PJ; SEIDMANN, A			OPTIMIZING PROCESSING RATES FOR FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							ALLOCATION; ECONOMICS; RESOURCE; MODELS	This paper introduces the generic concept of processing rates as decision variables in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS's). The objective is to determine the minimum cost processing rates given the FMS throughout target, the work-in-process level, part routes, transporter delays, and the variable capacity cost function for each machine. A nonlinear Mean Value Analysis queueing network optimization methodology is developed to control bottlenecks and queue lengths as the processing rates are varied. This methodology further provides the average and marginal unit production costs along with necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions for the FMS throughput targets. Industrial sample data is then used to illustrate the solution of the optimal tool speed problem in a metal-cutting FMS. Considerable cost savings are demonstrated using the proposed methodology in contrast with the conventional one-machine optimization models. Several economic insights regarding the issues of capacity allocation for FMS's, and a generalization of the square root capacity allocation rule for closed networks of queues, are also presented.

In this paper two related bicriteria mathematical programming models are developed for identifying the trade-offs between overall output (effectiveness) and equity that result from alternative allocations of service resources among different service delivery sites (branches). The models developed here incorporate equity in a more satisfactory manner than have previous efforts. An illustrative application of the models to the allocation of new books among the branches of a public library system is presented.

J	HENNART, JF				HENNART, JF			THE TRANSACTION COSTS THEORY OF JOINT VENTURES - AN EMPIRICAL-STUDY OF JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE UNITED-STATES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article								This paper offers the first large sample empirical study of the factors which influence the choice of Japanese firms between full or partial ownership of their U.S. manufacturing subsidiaries. It studies for the first time the ownership policies of investors of a single home country in a single host country, thus keeping variations within home and host countries constant. One methodological improvement over previous studies is the use as independent variables of the relevant characteristics of the investing firms. These had been proxied in previous studies by data on U.S. industries entered. The results suggest that the degree of ownership taken by Japanese manufacturing investors in their American subsidiaries is driven by the same general transaction costs variables that determine the choices made by the U.S. counterparts: Japanese parents joint venture when they need to combine with other firms intermediate inputs which are subject to high market transaction costs. An intriguing result, however, is the lack of significance of two variables which, in the U.S. case, strongly push towards full control of foreign subsidiaries. In this study neither the Japanese parent's R&D nor its advertising intensities had any significant impact on their ownership policies.

J	JAGANNATHAN, R; SEN, T				JAGANNATHAN, R; SEN, T			STORING CROSS-MATCHED BLOOD - A PERISHABLE INVENTORY MODEL WITH PRIOR ALLOCATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						HEALTH CARE; BLOOD BANK; PERISHABLE INVENTORY; BROWNIAN MOTION; DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS	MANAGEMENT; POLICIES	The process of testing a sample of a patient's blood against units of blood from inventory to ensure compatibility is called crossmatching. When a physician orders blood, it is crossmatched and then held for a patient. As a precautionary measure, physicians tend to order blood in excess of the amount that is transfused (used by the patient). Consequently, a large proportion of blood held for a patient (often higher than 50 percent) is eventually not transfused. This leads to increased outdates. The effects of crossmatching on outdates are widely acknowledged, but have seldom been included in blood inventory control models. In this paper, we develop a model for determining outdates and shortages for crossmatched blood using generally accepted parameters, such as proportion of crossmatched blood that is actually transfused, and the number of days after which crossmatched blood is released if not transfused.

Using data from two manufacturing departments in an electronic equipment company, we construct a model of productivity improvement as a function of cumulative output and two managerial variables-engineering changes and workforce training. Exploration of this model highlights the complex relationship between first-order and second-order learning.

This type of network is commonly encountered in several manufacturing applications. We provide bounds on the performance of the approximations for single and multiple machine stations. Our results suggest that the methods perform satisfactorily. These approximations can be used in conjunction with parametric decomposition methods to analyze queueing networks. The computational results indicate that the performance of the decomposition approach does not deteriorate when combined with the methods proposed in this paper.

This paper shows that this conjecture is false. The paper provides several families of utility functions, all of whose members violate the IIA property; moreover, it is shown that the set of utility functions violating the IIA property is quite large, and that it is widespread throughout the entire space of utility functions.

For this model they propose an approximation for long-run average performance measures called the pointwise stationary approximation (PSA), which consists of an appropriate weighted average of the performance measure that would result at each point in time if the system were stationary with the arrival rate that applies at that point in time. In this paper we verify their conjecture that PSA is asymptotically correct as the service and arrival rates increase with the instantaneous traffic intensity held fixed (corresponding to long arrival rate cycles). We actually establish both pointwise and average versions of this result for general time-dependent birth-and-death processes.		WHITT, W (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS,MURRAY HILL,NJ 07974, USA.

These groups may correspond to learning in process, materials or technology. This approach suggests a new budget methodology, the Learning Rate Budget (LRB), which combines activities with similar learning rates to facilitate planning, forecasting, bidding, accountability, and management control. This new conceptualization of cost progress rests on three postulates concerning the budget, the technology and a finite basis for the learning curve. This paper explores these postulates, presents the LRB, and summarizes the empirical study that led to this concept.

Firms are seeking out partners that will provide them the necessary leverage to achieve their various growth and diversification goals. Based on the balance model developed by Farquhar and Rao, this paper suggests a multi-attribute approach for evaluating acquisition partners. The appropriateness of this approach in the decision of one firm to acquire another firm is investigated using experimental methods. The context of the cosmetic industry is used in this empirical application. Results indicate that the balance model is quite suitable in describing the acquisition decision.

J	LOVELL, CAK; MOREY, RC				LOVELL, CAK; MOREY, RC			THE ALLOCATION OF CONSUMER INCENTIVES TO MEET SIMULTANEOUS SALES QUOTAS - AN APPLICATION TO UNITED-STATES-ARMY RECRUITING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COST EFFICIENCY; MILITARY RECRUITING		Consumer incentives often have a dual role: to expand the market and to redistribute the market so as to meet sales targets for a range of products. The proper allocation of incentives must recognize and deal with the competitive and "cannibalizing" effects operating among product classes. The presence of environmental factors, scale economies, and cost per unit for each of the candidate incentive types also must be accounted for. This paper develops and illustrates an analytical approach designed to improve the allocation of consumer incentives where sales targets are exogenously set. The model generates a system of simultaneous behavioral equations, a portion of which is included to reflect attempted cost minimizing behavior. The model is applied to FY81-FY86 data from the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, which allocated over $1 billion for special incentives to selected recruits. The incentives consist of enlistment bonuses and educational benefits offered to quality recruits who select critical occupational specialities. The sales targets are enlistment quotas for each of the occupational specialties that must be simultaneously satisfied. The Army's goal is to meet these quotas, in a postulated recruiting environment, at minimum total incentive expenditure. Results suggest that the Army could improve the cost-effectiveness of its recruiting effort through a reallocation of the incentives it offers to recruits. Misallocation during the FY81-FY86 period is estimated to have cost the Army approximately 3.5% of its total incentives expended in infantry recruiting.

In order to achieve accurate estimation results, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 specifies requirements that are unique to this estimation problem. This study investigates the impact of these requirements on estimation effectiveness. The results indicate that these requirements fail to achieve their purpose. The study also notes the importance of addressing the form of the underlying population of electrical demand.

J	CONNER, KR; RUMELT, RP				CONNER, KR; RUMELT, RP			SOFTWARE PIRACY - AN ANALYSIS OF PROTECTION STRATEGIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; COMPATIBILITY; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS	Software piracy by users is generally believed to harm both software firms (through lower profits) and buying customers (through higher prices). Thus, it is thought that perfect and costless technological protection would benefit both firms and consumers. The model developed here suggests that in some circumstances, even with significant piracy, not protecting can be the best policy, both raising firm profits and lowering selling prices. Key to the analysis is joining the presence of a positive network externality with the fact that piracy increases the total number of program users. The network externality exists because consumers have an incentive to economize on post-purchase learning and customization costs.

In the proposed model, essential characteristics of R&D projects are incorporated. Namely, the activities and the technological specifications of the project are selected dynamically, and the stopping time of the R&D process is introduced as a decision variable to be determined endogeneously. We characterize the collection of optimal sequencing of R&D activities that would maximize the expected net present value of the project, and we evaluate the possibility of incorporating various learning aspects into the model. We further analyze a resource allocation problem associated with the R&D model. It is shown that in certain cases one can efficiently implement a greedy-optimal resource allocation procedure for increasing the expected net present value of the R&D project.

In this paper, we explicitly incorporate various types of costs to a one-state advertising model to analyze the effect of these costs on the optimal advertising policy. We prove that the interaction of fixed and pulsing costs does make pulsing optimal under a reasonable condition. This result not only identifies an important factor that leads to the optimality of pulsing, but also generalizes the finding obtained by Sasieni (1971).

J	ZAJAC, EJ; GOLDEN, BR; SHORTELL, SM				ZAJAC, EJ; GOLDEN, BR; SHORTELL, SM			NEW ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS FOR ENHANCING INNOVATION - THE CASE OF INTERNAL CORPORATE JOINT VENTURES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							FIRM	Organizations have increasingly turned to alternative organizational forms such as joint ventures and internal corporate ventures to enhance innovation. The present study examines the use of a similar, newly-developing organizational form for purposes of innovation; namely, the internal corporate joint venture (ICJV), which has characteristics of both traditional joint ventures and internal corporate venturing. This study presents an industry-specific analysis of innovation across 53 ICJV's (hospital/physician group combinations), using qualitative and quantitive analyses to identify those factors most strongly associated with the degree of innovativeness in these new organizations. The empirical findings suggest three factors most significantly associated with innovation in the JCJV's in our sample: (1) age similarity among organizational members, (2) the sponsoring organization's orientation towards innovation, and (3) ICJV participation in integrative activities with the sponsoring organization. The study concludes by suggesting that greater attention be devoted to studying "nested innovation," i.e., innovation within a new organizational form that is itself an administrative innovation.

J	KAO, EPC; NARAYANAN, KS				KAO, EPC; NARAYANAN, KS			MODELING A MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEM WITH PREEMPTIVE PRIORITIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							MARKOV-CHAINS; DISTRIBUTIONS; EQUATIONS; QUEUE	Consider a system with N processors and two job types with one having preemptive priority over the other. Arrivals are Poisson and service times are exponential. We present two approaches for modeling the system. The difference between the two lies in the order with which we list the numbers of jobs of each type in the system in the state definition. Although both approaches yield matrix-geometric solutions, their implications for computation are significantly different. The first approach has attractive structural properties and an easily solvable rate matrix, but the system of equations at the boundary is most often prohibitively large. The second approach, while not amenable to any easy computation of its rate matrix, renders itself to an efficient solution at the boundary, and provides a basis for waiting time analysis for low priority jobs. In the paper, we present an efficient implementation of state reduction for solving the stationary probabilities associated with the boundary states. We give a numerical example to highlight various issues in the computer solution.

J	BARD, JF; BENNETT, JE				BARD, JF; BENNETT, JE			ARC REDUCTION AND PATH PREFERENCE IN STOCHASTIC ACYCLIC NETWORKS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							CONDITIONAL MONTE-CARLO; PROJECT COMPLETION-TIME; SHORTEST ROUTE PROBLEM; PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; PERT NETWORKS	The paper presents a heuristic for determining the path that maximizes the expected utility of a stochastic acyclic network. The focus is on shortest route problems where a general, nonlinear utility function is used to measure outcomes. For such problems, enumerating all feasible paths is the only way to guarantee that the global optimum has been found. Alternatively, we develop a reduction algorithm based on stochastic dominance to speed up the computations. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the approach. In all, 70 test problems comprising 20 to 60 nodes are randomly generated and analyzed. The results indicate that the heuristic produces significant computational saving as the size of the network grows, and that the quality of the reduced network solutions are better than those obtained from the original formulation.

J	SIMMS, BW; PETERSEN, ER				SIMMS, BW; PETERSEN, ER			AN INFORMATION-PROCESSING MODEL OF A POLICE ORGANIZATION	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article								A model has been developed to study economic decision making in police organizations. The conceptual viewpoint taken is that police organizations are information processing systems, with activities connected in a communication network. The resulting model is process-oriented, and organizational decisions are analyzed by studying how the police force senses, learns about, and solves a stream of criminal events. Search theory is used to model the information processing activities and to study the value of unit memory, communication between units and the coordination of two or more units. A computer model links the units and activities in a simulation of the police force organization. Examples based on a municipal police force are used to highlight the concepts of the model building approach. The implementation of the computer model using police force data is reported.

J	PIRKUL, H; SCHILLING, DA				PIRKUL, H; SCHILLING, DA			THE MAXIMAL COVERING LOCATION PROBLEM WITH CAPACITIES ON TOTAL WORKLOAD	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							SERVICE	The Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) has been the focus of considerable attention both in research and practice for some time, and numerous extensions have been proposed to broaden its appeal and enhance its applicability. In this paper, we are concerned with the addition of workload limits on the facilities. While not generally difficult to formulate, these capacity constraints make the model substantially more difficult to solve, as well as create certain pathological results, particularly in the assignment of uncovered demand to facilities. First we discuss these pathologies and extend the capacitated MCLP to address them. Then, we present an efficient solution procedure that is applicable to both simple and extended problem formulations. Finally, results of extensive tests on the solution procedure are presented and a "real-world" scale example is solved to explore the implications of the model.

In this research we develop an estimable production frontier model of software maintenance, using a new methodology that allows the simultaneous estimation of both the production frontier and the effects of several productivity factors. Our model allows deviations on both sides of the estimated frontier to reflect the impact of both production inefficiencies and random effects such as measurement errors. The model is then estimated using an empirical dataset of 65 software maintenance projects from a large commercial bank. The insights obtained from the estimation results are found to be quite consistent for reasonable variations in the specification of the model. Estimates of the marginal impacts of all of the included productivity factors are obtained to aid managers in improving productivity in software maintenance.

J	KOGUT, B				KOGUT, B			JOINT VENTURES AND THE OPTION TO EXPAND AND ACQUIRE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						JOINT VENTURES; TERMINATION BY ACQUISITION; REAL OPTIONS; OPTION TO EXPAND; LEARNING	STRATEGY	This article develops the perspective that joint ventures are created as real options to expand in response to future technological and market developments. The exercise of the option is accompanied by an acquisition of the venture. It is hypothesized that the timing of the acquisition should be triggered by a product market signal indicating an increase in the venture's valuation. Based on a sample of 92 manufacturing joint ventures, this hypothesis is tested by estimating the effect of product market signals on the hazard of acquisition. The results indicate that unexpected growth in the product market increases the likelihood of acquisition: unexpected shortfalls in product shipments have no effect on the likelihood of dissolution. This asymmetry in the results strongly supports the interpretation of joint ventures as options to expand.		KOGUT, B (reprint author), UNIV PENN,WHARTON SCH,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104, USA.

J	MILLER, D				MILLER, D			STALE IN THE SADDLE - CEO TENURE AND THE MATCH BETWEEN ORGANIZATION AND ENVIRONMENT	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONAL ADAPTATION; FIT BETWEEN ORGANIZATION AND ENVIRONMENT; CEO TENURE	QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES; EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION; CONTINGENCY APPROACH; LARGE CORPORATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; DETERMINANTS; UNCERTAINTY; COVARIANCE; REVOLUTION	It has often been argued that an organization's strategy and structure must be tailored or matched to the challenges posed by its environment. Our research shows that this match is less likely to be achieved by long-tenured CEO's than by their counterparts with less tenure. It also suggests that the failure to match strategy and environment hurts financial performance. More specifically, CEO tenure related inversely to the prescribed match between organization and environment, especially in uncertain settings and where ownership was concentrated. The match between environment and strategy was in turn positively related to financial performance.

The first is a class of single stage problems involving joint machine capacity constraints and/or start up costs, and the second is a class of multistage problems with general product structure. The problems are solved as mixed integer programs based on (i) an appropriate choice of the initial problem formulation and (ii) the addition of cuts which are generated automatically by a mathematical programming system (MPSARX). Our results extend and complement those of Karmarker and Schrage (1985). Afentakis and Gavish (1986), Eppen and Martin (1987) and Van Roy and Wolsey (1987). A major advantage of this approach is its robustness or flexibility. By using just a matrix generator and a mathematical programming system with automatic cut generation routines we can formulate and solve model variants without incurring the costs of adapting an algorithm.

The exogenous demands are independent Poisson processes. The transit times between locations may be stochastic. The way we model these transit times follows closely the standard treatment of stochastic leadtimes in single-location models. This is different, however, from the usual approach in the multiechelon setting (e.g., METRIC). We describe simple methods for computing or approximating the steady-state behavior of the system. The results show that, in sharp contrast to prior multiechelon models, transit-time variances play an important role in system performance.

The pointwise stationary approximation is computed by integrating over time (that is taking the expectation of) the formula for the stationary performance measure with the arrival rate that applies at each point in time. This approximation, which has been empirically confirmed as a tight upper bound of the true value, is shown to be very accurate for a range of parameter values corresponding to a reasonably broad spectrum of real systems.

J	ABRAMSON, D				ABRAMSON, D			CONSTRUCTING SCHOOL TIMETABLES USING SIMULATED ANNEALING - SEQUENTIAL AND PARALLEL ALGORITHMS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SIMULATED ANNEALING; OPTIMIZATION; SCHEDULING		This paper considers a solution to the school timetabling problem. The timetabling problem involves scheduling a number of tuples, each consisting of class of students, a teacher, a subject and a room, to a fixed number of time slots. A Monte Carlo scheme called simulated annealing is used as an optimisation technique. The paper introduces the timetabling problem, and then describes the simulated annealing method. Annealing is then applied to the timetabling problem. A prototype timetabling environment is described followed by some experimental results. A parallel algorithm which can be implemented on a multiprocessor is presented. This algorithm can provide a faster solution than the equivalent sequential algorithm. Some further experimental results are given.		ABRAMSON, D (reprint author), ROYAL MELBOURNE INST TECHNOL,DEPT COMMUN & ELECTR ENGN,CSIRO,DIV INFORMAT TECHNOL,POB 2476V,MELBOURNE,VIC 3001,AUSTRALIA.

In this paper, we show that there is a method of solving such problems that requires the addition of but a single auxiliary state variable. The technique is illustrated by examining an adjustable rat mortgage (ARM) with yearly and lifetime caps. The ARM amortizes and can be prepaid at any time. We also handle other prominent features of ARMs including points and teasers. This method of using a single auxiliary state variable to handle path dependencies is a general one, applicable to more complex models of the economic environment and to other financial contracts.

J	SICK, GA				SICK, GA			TAX-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TAX; PERSONAL TAX RATE; DISCOUNT RATE; COST OF CAPITAL; CAPITAL BUDGETING	OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE; LEVERAGE CLIENTELES; FINANCIAL LEVERAGE; AGENCY PROBLEMS; CORPORATE; DEBT; EQUILIBRIUM; TAXATION; MARKET; MODEL	This paper develops models for discount rates that are adjusted for the interest tax shields of an infra-marginal firm in a general tax equilibrium where there is cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates. Under the assumption that the firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt ratio, a tax-adjusted riskless discount rate model is given for valuing certainty-equivalents and a tax-and-risk-adjusted discount rate model is given for valuing expected cash flows. For the latter case, the asset, equity, debt and tax-shield betas are derived and a weighted average cost of capital interpretation is given. The tax-adjusted CAPM/APT security market lines for expected returns in stock and bond markets both have the same slope but different intercepts. A formula is also provided for the present value of the interest tax shield when the firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt level. The analysis here also differs from the existing literature in the following respects: It allows for cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates and personal tax rates. It shows that the market values of risky and riskless interest tax shields differ only to the extent that tax laws provide for nonlinear taxation of gains and losses. It also shows that interest tax shields should be discounted at a tax-adjusted discount rate that reflects the fact that they accrue to equity investors, rather than debt investors. Continuous-time simplifications of the formulas in this paper and the previous literature are also given.

J	SCHOEMAKER, PJH				SCHOEMAKER, PJH			ARE RISK-ATTITUDES RELATED ACROSS DOMAINS AND RESPONSE-MODES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						RISK-ATTITUDE; EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY; RESPONSE MODE EFFECTS	INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR; UTILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PROSPECT; PSYCHOLOGY; DECISION; CHOICE	This paper examines experimentally the nature of people's risk-attitudes across different payoff domains and response modes. Only simple gambles are examined, entailing just two monetary outcomes. The main issue of interest is to what extent risk-preferences in one domain or response mode predict anything (beyond chance) about risk-preferences in another domain or mode. Three domains are examined: gain, mixed and loss. The three response modes used are certainty equivalence (CE), probability equivalence (PE) and outcome equivalence (OE) judgments. In general, weak associations were found among ordinal risk-preferences within-subjects across domains, especially with respect to losses. To make the parametric responses (i.e., the CE, PE and OE judgments) comparable across domains and subjects, linear as well as utility-based risk-measures were examined. In the gain and loss domains, the linear risk-premia measures exhibited higher CE-PE correlations (within domain) than the utility-based measures. Using a multitrait-multimethod comparison, the highest correlations were found within domains across response modes. The main findings are (1) strong risk-aversion for gain and mixed gambles, (2) risk-seeking for symmetric loss gambles, although less pronounced, (3) low correlation of risk-preferences within subjects across domains, (4) high convergent validity of response methods within domain, and (5) increased risk-aversion for loss (but not gain) gambles when using real payoffs.

J	KOHLI, R; SUKUMAR, R				KOHLI, R; SUKUMAR, R			HEURISTICS FOR PRODUCT-LINE DESIGN USING CONJOINT-ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING PRODUCT POLICY; CONJOINT ANALYSIS; PROGRAMMING HEURISTICS	ALGORITHMS; LOCATION	Recently proposed methods for product-line selection use the total utilities of candidate items to construct product lines maximizing seller's return or buyers' welfare. For conjoint (hybrid conjoint) data, enumerating the utilities of candidate items can be computationally infeasible if the number of attributes and attribute levels is large and most multi-attribute alternatives are feasible. For such problems, constructing product lines directly from part-worths data is preferable. We propose such methods, extending Kohli and Krishnamurti's (1987) dynamic-programming heuristic for selecting a single item maximizing share to structure product lines maximizing share, seller's return, or buyers' (utilitarian) welfare. The computational performance of the heuristics and their approximation of product-line solutions is evaluated using simulated data. Across problem instances, the dynamic-programming heuristics identify solutions that are no worse, in terms of approximating optimal solutions, to the solutions of heuristics for the current two-step approaches to product-line design.

First, conditions are described that correspond to different choices of an arithmetic operation that measures the importance of changes in consequences. Second, conditions are described such that one consequence in a pair of indifferent lotteries depends linearly on a consequence in the other lottery. Procedures are described for using one of the conditions to model the risk attitude of a public or private decision making group without performing the detailed preference assessments that are needed to determine a general utility function.

The model assumes a general nonlinear delay cost structure and incorporates the tradeoff between the delay cost and capacity cost. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of a pricing rule that charges out service resources at their marginal capacity cost. We examine the issue of budgetary balance and find that net-value maximization entails a budget deficit for the service facility; that is, the service facility should be evaluated as a "deficit center." The results provide guidelines under which the optimal magnitude of the deficit can be determined.

J	TANG, CS				TANG, CS			THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTY ON A PRODUCTION LINE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STOCHASTIC SYSTEM; PRODUCTION CONTROL; INVENTORY CONTROL; APPROXIMATION; PULL SYSTEMS	SYSTEM	This paper presents a discrete time model of a multi-stage production system that faces two major types of uncertainties: the output rate at each production stage and the demand for the finished product. Our goal is to analyze the impact of these uncertainties on the production level and on the inventory level at each stage in order to provide insights for production planning, inventory control, quality improvement, and capacity planning. We propose a scheme in which a complex production rule is approximated by a linear production rule (that follows the "restoration" concept introduced by Denardo and Tang 1988). This linear production rule leads the system to steady state in which the means and the variances of the production and inventory levels can be expressed in closed form. These closed form expressions enable us to develop a simple approach for determining a "good" production rule and for analyzing the impact of increasing the yield rates and reducing the variance of the demand. The goodness of this approximation scheme is illustrated by an example.

Material Requirements Planning literature reveals that MRP implementations are seldom adjusted in any systematic way to account for such yield improvement. A single product, single stage MRP model is developed which incorporates learning curve behavior into conventional MRP logic. A series of experiments systematically examine the impact on mean inventory level of various combinations of environmental conditions and managerial policies. The research demonstrates that substantial reductions in mean inventory levels can be realized in low yield environments if learning is properly included in the order release logic. This finding proves to be robust with respect to modest errors in the estimation of learning rate.

J	MITRA, D; MITRANI, I				MITRA, D; MITRANI, I			ANALYSIS OF A KANBAN DISCIPLINE FOR CELL COORDINATION IN PRODUCTION LINES .1.	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STOCHASTIC MANUFACTURING MODELS; CONTROL AND COORDINATION POLICIES; FIXED-POINT APPROXIMATIONS	JUST-IN-TIME; PRODUCTION SYSTEM; BLOCKING; INVENTORY; NETWORKS; MODELS; QUEUES; SPACE	We describe and analyze a discipline called kanban for the coordination of cells in a large-scale manufacturing facility. There are many cells in a tandem configuration and a fixed number of cards (or kanbans in Japanese usage) in each cell. The cards circulate within the cell and their presence at designated positions signals to the neighboring cells the status of the cell's inventory; rules specify the timing of the movement of parts from cell to cell. We construct a stochastic model of the whole manufacturing facility and give our results in three parts. First, the kanban discipline is compared to the classical production discipline and it is shown to dominate the classical discipline in terms of throughput. Secondly, we give a scheme for analyzing approximately the performance of the kanban system by examining first a single cell in isolation and then combining the isolated cells through fixed-point equations. Thirdly, we report on extensive experiments and on their numerical results which are obtained from simulations and our method of analysis. The throughput-inventory relationship of the kanban scheme is observed to be superior to that of the classical discipline.

J	MORRIS, JS; TERSINE, RJ				MORRIS, JS; TERSINE, RJ			A SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF GROUP TECHNOLOGY CELLULAR LAYOUTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						GROUP TECHNOLOGY; PLANT DESIGN; SIMULATION		Group Technology (GT) is a multi-faceted approach to batch production that includes the reconfiguration of plant equipment from a functional layout to a series of product-oriented layouts that are referred to as manufacturing cells. The cells are dedicated to process families of parts that have similar machine operations. The purported benefits of GT over traditional functional layouts range from reduced work-in-process inventory and throughput times to increased worker satisfaction and productivity. However, recent simulation studies challenge some of these claims of superior performance for cellular layouts. This research examines the influence that factors in a firm's operating environment have on the performance of cellular layouts. A simulation model using hypothetical shop data is used to compare a process layout to a cellular layout using mean throughput time and mean level of work-in-process inventory as performance measures. The operating variables analyzed are (1) the ratio of setup to process time, (2) transfer time of material between work centers, (3) demand stability, and (4) the flow of work within cells. None of the individual changes in levels of operating variables produced a clear advantage for cellular layouts. However, the results from these experiments were used to postulate an "ideal" environment for cellular layouts. This environment is characterized as having a high ratio of setup to process time, stable demand, unidirectional flow of work within a cell, and a substantial level of material movement times between process departments. When all of these conditions are present, the cellular layout outperforms the process layout on both performance measures.

J	GALLEGO, G				GALLEGO, G			SCHEDULING THE PRODUCTION OF SEVERAL ITEMS WITH RANDOM DEMANDS IN A SINGLE FACILITY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						LOT SIZING; PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; OPTIMAL CONTROL; RANDOM DEMANDS	MACHINE	Consider the problem of scheduling the production of several items in a single facility that can produce only one item at a time. This problem occurs since it is often economic to produce several items in a single facility. The objective is to reduce the long run average holding, backorder and setup costs. We assume that demands are random with constant expected rates. We allow backorders and charge holding and backlogging costs at linear time weighted rates. Items are produced at continuous constant rates. Setup times and setup costs are item dependent constants. These parameters, however, are independent of the order of setups. A real-time scheduling tool is developed in three steps. First, with demands replaced by their expectations, we compute an optimal or near-optimal target cyclic schedule. Next, we study the problem of scheduling the facility after a single disruption perturbs the inventories. The goal is to recover the target cyclic schedule at minimal excess over the average cost of the cyclic schedule. We formulate this as a control problem and obtain a linear recovery policy that is optimal for a large configuration of disruptions. Finally, we select safety stocks to minimize the long run average cost of following the target schedule with the recovery policy. We show that optimal safety stocks are unique and have the property that in the long run the proportion of time that an item is in stock is the ratio of backorder to holding plus backorder cost. We present an example that integrates the cyclic schedule, the control policy and the safety stocks.		GALLEGO, G (reprint author), COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN & OPERAT RES,NEW YORK,NY 10027, USA.
