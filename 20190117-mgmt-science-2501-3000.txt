In this paper, we first describe major issues in traditional supply chain management. Next, we focus our attention on the supply chain issues of visibility supplier relationships, distribution and pricing, customization, and real-time decision technologies that have risen to importance with the prevalence of e-business. We present an overview of relevant analytical research models that have been developed in these areas, discuss their contributions, and conclude with a discussion on future modeling opportunities in this area.

J	Dellarocas, C				Dellarocas, C			The digitization of word of mouth: Promise and challenges of online feedback mechanisms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						reputation mechanisms; online feedback; electronic markets; trust; Internet; game theory	EBAY AUCTIONS; REPUTATION; MARKET; INFORMATION; ECONOMICS; PREMIUMS; QUALITY; ENTRY	Online feedback mechanisms harness the bidirectional communication capabilities of the Internet to engineer large-scale, word-of-mouth networks. Best known so far as a technology for building trust and fostering cooperation in online marketplaces, such as eBay, these mechanisms are poised to have a much wider impact on organizations. Their growing popularity has potentially important implications for a wide range of management activities such as brand building, customer acquisition and retention, product development, and quality assurance. This paper surveys our progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that these mechanisms represent. It discusses some important dimensions in which Internet-based feedback mechanisms differ from traditional word-of-mouth networks and surveys the most important issues related to their design, evaluation, and use. It provides an overview of relevant work in game theory and economics on the topic of reputation. It discusses how this body of work is being extended and combined with insights from computer science, management science, sociology, and psychology to take into consideration the special properties of online environments. Finally, it identifies opportunities that this new area presents for operations research/management science (OR/MS) research.

Unfortunately, demand is outpacing the capacity of the infrastructure, as evidenced by unacceptably long response times. To support current load and further growth, we must address this problem. Several caching strategies have been proposed in the literature; many have been implemented to improve the quality of service on the Web. In this paper, we identify the main causes of delay on the Web, and provide a review of the various caching strategies employed to mitigate these delays. We also survey the application of Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) techniques to caching on the Web. Finally, we identify several open OR/MS research problems related to Web caching.

J	Besanko, D; Dube, JP; Gupta, S				Besanko, D; Dube, JP; Gupta, S			Competitive price discrimination strategies in a vertical channel using aggregate retail data	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						price discrimination; competition; channels of distribution; scanner data	CHOICE MODELS; BRAND CHOICE; HETEROGENEITY; EQUILIBRIUM; ELASTICITY	We explore opportunities for targeted pricing for a retailer that only tracks weekly store-level aggregate sales and marketing-mix information. We show that it is possible, using these data, to recover essential features of the underlying distribution of consumer willingness to pay. Knowledge of this distribution may enable the retailer to generate additional profits from targeting by using choice information at the checkout counter. In estimating demand we incorporate a supply-side model of the distribution channel that captures important features of competitive price-setting behavior of firms. This latter aspect helps us control for the potential endogeneity generated by unmeasured product characteristics in aggregate data. The channel controls for competitive aspects both between manufacturers and between manufacturers and a retailer. Despite this competition, we find that targeted pricing need not generate the prisoner's dilemma in our data. This contrasts with the findings of theoretical models due to the flexibility of the empirical model of demand. The demand system we estimate captures richer forms of product differentiation, both vertical and horizontal, as well as a more flexible distribution of consumer heterogeneity.

J	Ha, AY; Li, LD; Ng, SM				Ha, AY; Li, LD; Ng, SM			Price and delivery logistics competition in a supply chain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; delivery; logistics; inventory; just-in-time; supplier management; supply chain competition	QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; TIME COMPETITION; COORDINATION; ENVIRONMENT; INFORMATION; PROFITS; POLICY; MODEL	We consider a supply chain in which two suppliers compete for supply to a customer. Pricing and delivery-frequency decisions in the system are analyzed by two three-stage noncooperative games with different decision rights designated to the parties involved. The customer first sets the price (or delivery frequency) for each supplier. Then, the suppliers offer the delivery frequencies (or prices) simultaneously and independently. Finally, the customer determines how much demand to allocate to each of the suppliers. We show that delivery frequency, similar to delivery speed in time-based competition, can be a source of competitive advantage. It also allows firms that sell identical products to offer complementary services to the customer because she can lower her inventory with deliveries from more suppliers. In general, higher delivery frequencies lower the value of getting deliveries from the second supplier and therefore intensify price competition. Assuming the cost structures do not change and the suppliers are identical, we show that when the customer controls deliveries, she would strategically increase delivery frequencies to lower prices. The distortion in delivery frequencies is larger and the overall performance of the supply chain is lower when the customer, not the suppliers, controls deliveries. Moreover, the customer is better off under delivery competition, while the suppliers are better off under price competition.

The downstream facility faces discrete stochastic demand and passes supply requests to the upstream facility. The upstream facility always meets the supply requests from downstream. If the upstream facility cannot meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is optimal. Numerical analysis provides insight into the optimal policies and allows us to compare the supply chains under centralized and decentralized control.

J	Axsater, S				Axsater, S			A new decision rule for lateral transshipments in inventory systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory control; emergency supply; lateral transshipments; stochastic	MODELS; POLICY	This paper deals with a single-echelon inventory system consisting of a number of parallel local warehouses facing compound Poisson demand. There are standard holding and backorder costs as well as ordering costs at all warehouses. Normally, the warehouses replenish from an outside supplier. However, lateral transshipments between the warehouses are also possible. Such transshipments take no time but incur additional costs. When a demand,occurs at a warehouse, the question is whether the whole demand or part of it should be covered by a lateral transshipment from another warehouse. Given a set of alternative decisions, our decision rule minimizes the expected costs under the assumption that no further transshipments will take place. This rule is then used repeatedly as a heuristic. A simulation study illustrates how the suggested technique performs under different conditions.

By framing the task of knowledge integration as a cycle, we highlight the inability of current knowledge transfer theories to explain the consequences that arise from the path-dependent nature of knowledge. We compare the complexity of this knowledge integration task to previous efforts in terms of its novelty and the organizational properties of specialization and dependence that are required. Drawing on evidence from two empirical studies, we outline three stages of the "knowledge transformation cycle," which addresses the complexity of this integration task. We conclude with the implications of this knowledge transformation cycle on our understanding of knowledge management and organizational learning.

J	John, A; Klein, J				John, A; Klein, J			The boycott puzzle: Consumer motivations for purchase sacrifice	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						free riding; boycott; consumer protests	COLLECTIVE ACTION; PERSPECTIVE; PRODUCT; DILEMMA	A boycott is never far from a firm's exchanges with its customers. Researchers in marketing need to understand consumer protest behavior, both to aid nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who wish to organize boycotts, and to assist managers who wish to develop appropriate strategic responses. Boycotts, like many other instances of collective action, are subject to free-rider and small-agent problems: there appears to be little or no motivation for an individual to participate. Yet they assuredly occur. We take an economic and psychological approach to the study of boycotts. Our approach is to develop a typology of motivations for consumer boycotts, to embed these motivations explicitly in a dynamic economic model, and thus to offer explanations for the extent of boycott participation.

J	Ibanez, A				Ibanez, A			Robust pricing of the American put option: A note on Richardson extrapolation and the early exercise premium	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						American put option; Richardson extrapolation; early exercise premium	ANALYTICAL VALUATION; BARRIER OPTIONS	This paper presents a detailed analysis of the numerical implementation of the American put option decomposition into an equivalent European option plus an early exercise premium (Kim 1990, Jacka 1991, Carr et al. 1992). It subsequently introduces a. new algorithm based upon this decomposition and Richardson extrapolation. This new algorithm is based upon (a) the derivation of the correct order for the error term when applying Richardson extrapolation, which is used to control the error of the extrapolated prices, (b) an innovative adjustment of Kim's (1990) discrete-time early exercise premium, so that these premiums monotonically converge and, therefore, it is appropriate to use them in extrapolation, and (c) the optimal exercise frontier can be quickly computed through Newton's method, permitting the efficient implementation of the decomposition formula in practice. Numerical experiments show that this new algorithm is accurate, efficient, easy to implement, and competitive in comparison with other methods. Finally, it can also be applied to other American exotic securities.

J	Soman, D; Shi, MZ				Soman, D; Shi, MZ			Virtual progress: The effect of path characteristics on perceptions of progress and choice	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						goal-oriented services; behavioral decision making; progress; choice; path characteristics; transportation	RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS; PERSONAL GOALS; TIME; EXPERIENCES; SATISFACTION; DURATION; BEHAVIOR; SERVICE; MONEY; PAIN	In goal-oriented services, consumers want to get transported from one well-defined state (start) to another (destination) state without much concern for intermediate states. A cost-based evaluation of such services should depend on the total cost associated with the service-i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further, we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress), consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average progress.

J	Pennings, JME; Smidts, A				Pennings, JME; Smidts, A			The shape of utility functions and organizational behavior	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						heterogeneity in utility functions; organizational behavior; S-shaped utility function; real decision makers; reference points	PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FUNCTION; PARAMETER-FREE ELICITATION; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISK ATTITUDE; LOSS AVERSION; CHOICE; PREFERENCES; DECISION; REFLECTION; PRICES	Based on measurements among 332 owner-managers, we investigate how the global shape of the utility function (i.e., S-shaped versus concave or convex over the total range of outcomes) relates to choice behavior. We find that the global shape of the utility function differs across decision makers (about one-third of the owner-managers exhibit an S-shaped utility function) and that the global shape is linked to organizational behavior (i.e., the production system employed), a result that does not change when using different methods to identify the decision maker's global shape of the utility function. The decision maker's risk attitude (risk averse or risk seeking) does not affect the choice of the production system. Whereas the degree of risk aversion, based on the local shape of the utility function, may be important in explaining owner-managers' trading behavior (Pennings and Smidts 2000), more structural organizational behavior appears to be linked to the global shape of the utility function.

J	Iyer, AV; Deshpande, V; Wu, ZP				Iyer, AV; Deshpande, V; Wu, ZP			A postponement model for demand management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						demand postponement; capacity planning; value of information	INVENTORY PROBLEM; PRODUCT; DIFFERENTIATION; POWER	In this paper, we analyze demand postponement as a strategy to handle potential demand surges. Under demand postponement, a fraction of the demands from the "regular" period are postponed and satisfied during a "postponement" period. This permits capacity to be procured to satisfy the postponed demands. A reimbursement per unit is paid to customers whose demands are postponed. The basic idea is that by preempting stockouts through demand postponement, we can reduce overall stockout costs. We formulate and solve a two-stage capacity planning problem under demand postponement. We propose a power range class of distributions to capture the nature of demand surges. We establish the scalability and conjugate properties of the power range distributions under demand postponement, which leads to a tractable analysis of the problem. We analytically solve the problem of determining the optimal regular and postponement period capacities, and the demand splitting rule to minimize the supplier's expected cost. We show that (a) the value of postponement may be significant depending on cost and demand parameters, (b) a postponement strategy may lead to reduced investment in initial capacity, and (c) it may be optimal to do no demand postponement over a range of demands even after observing a higher demand signal. We then relax several model assumptions and provide results for these extensions. We conclude with managerial insights.

We formally demonstrate that in the face of a market failure in which stakeholders refuse to align themselves with new firms, high-quality new ventures may be able to credibly signal their type by appointing reputable directors to their boards. However, this option is not universally feasible. Both directors' reputations and the quality of their information determine the effectiveness of this strategy. In contrast to earlier adverse selection models, we demonstrate that when the middlemen (directors) have incomplete information on firm quality, bad and good firms can coexist in equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the quality of the directors' information determines the mix of good and bad firms in the population of surviving firms. Avenues for future research and normative implications for practitioners are discussed.

J	Maglaras, C; Zeevi, A				Maglaras, C; Zeevi, A			Pricing and capacity sizing for systems with shared resources: Approximate solutions and scaling relations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						shared resources; heavy traffic; equilibrium; pricing; many-server limits	SERVICES; QUEUE	This paper considers pricing and capacity sizing decisions, in a single-class Markovian model motivated by communication and information services. The service provider is assumed to operate a finite set of processing resources that can be shared among users; however, this shared mode of operation results in a service-rate degradation. Users, in turn, are sensitive to the delay implied by the potential degradation in service rate, and to the usage fee charged for accessing the system. We study the equilibrium behavior of such systems in the specific context of pricing and capacity sizing under revenue and social optimization objectives. Exact solutions to these problems can only be obtained via exhaustive simulations. In contrast, we pursue approximate solutions that exploit large-capacity asymptotics. Economic considerations and natural scaling relations demonstrate that the optimal operational mode for the system is close to "heavy traffic." This, in turn, supports the derivation of simple approximate solutions to economic optimization problems, via asymptotic methods that completely alleviate the need for simulation. These approximations seem to be extremely accurate. The main insights that are gleaned in the analysis follow: congestion costs are "small," the optimal price admits a two-part decomposition, and the joint capacity sizing and pricing problem decouples and admits simple analytical solutions that are asymptotically optimal. All of the above phenomena are intimately related to statistical economies of scale that are an intrinsic part of these systems.

In addition, customization is more feasible today because of advances in manufacturing technologies that have improved sellers' manufacturing flexibility. We first develop a model of product customization and flexible pricing to incorporate the salient roles of the Internet and flexible manufacturing technologies in reducing the costs of designing and producing tailored consumer goods. We show how a monopoly seller may earn the highest profits by producing both standard and custom products and can raise prices for both types of products as customization and information collection technologies improve. Simultaneous adoption of customization in a duopoly reduces the differentiation between their standard products but does not intensify price competition. Compared with a. two-facility monopolist, the duopoly may underinvest in customization. Consumer surplus improves after sellers adopt customization. but does not monotonically increase as customization technologies advance. When firms face a fixed entry cost and adopt customization sequentially, the first entrant always achieves an advantage and may be able to deter subsequent entry by choosing its customization scope strategically.

J	Broadie, M; Yamamoto, Y				Broadie, M; Yamamoto, Y			Application of the fast Gauss transform to option pricing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						option pricing; American options; fast Gauss transform; jump-diffusion model	DISCRETE-TIME; VALUATION	In many of the numerical methods for pricing American options based on the dynamic programming approach, the most computationally intensive part can be formulated as the summation of Gaussians. Though this operation usually requires O(NN') work when there are N' summations to compute and the number of terms appearing m each summation is N, we can reduce the amount of work to O(N + N') by using a technique called the fast Gauss transform. In this paper, we apply this technique to the multinomial method and the stochastic mesh method, and show by numerical experiments how it can speed up these methods dramatically, both for the Black-Scholes model and Merton's lognormal jump-diffusion model. We also propose extensions of the fast Gauss transform method to models with non-Gaussian densities.

Local risk aversion is measured by the matrix of derivatives of the decision maker's risk-neutral probabilities, without reference to true subjective probabilities or riskless wealth positions, and comparative risk aversion is measured without requiring agreement on true probabilities. Risk-neutral probabilities and their derivatives are shown to be sufficient statistics for approximately optimal investment and financing decisions in complete markets for contingent claims.

J	Baucells, M; Sarin, RK				Baucells, M; Sarin, RK			Group decisions with multiple criteria	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multicriteria decision making; group decisions; preference aggregation; additive representation	ATTRIBUTE WEIGHTS; SYSTEMS	We consider a decision problem where a group of individuals evaluates multiattribute alternatives. We explore the minimal required agreements that are sufficient to specify the group utility function. A surprising result is that, under some conditions, a bilateral agreement among pairs of individuals on a single attribute is sufficient to derive the multiattribute group utility. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of an attribute, on an attribute evaluation function, or on willingness to pay. We focus on the case in which each individual's utility function is additive. We show that the group utility can be represented as the weighted sum of group attribute weights and, more remarkably, of attribute evaluation functions. These group attribute evaluation functions are in turn weighted sums of individual attribute evaluation functions.

Given the costs of treatment by the gatekeeper and. the specialist, we find. the firm.'s. optimal referral rate from a particular gatekeeper to the specialists. We then consider the principal-agent problem that arises when the gatekeeper, but not the firm, observes the gatekeeper's treatment ability as well as the complexity of each customer's problem. We examine the relative benefits of compensation systems designed to overcome the effects of this information asymmetry and show that, bonuses based solely on referral rates do not always ensure first-best system performance and that an appropriate bonus based on, customer volume may be necessary as well. We also consider the value of such output-based contracts when gatekeepers are, heterogeneous in ability so, that. two gatekeeper types face different probabilities of treatment success when given the same problem. We,show that the firm may achieve first-best performance by either offering. two contracts that separate the gatekeeper types or by offering a single contract that coordinates the treatment decisions of both gatekeepers.

J	Pentland, BT				Pentland, BT			Conceptualizing and measuring variety in the execution of organizational work processes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational routines; process variation; sequential variety; process complexity	COMPLEXITY; TECHNOLOGY; SEQUENCES; ROUTINES; SYSTEM; EVENTS	Variability in organizational work processes is believed to influence productivity quality, flexibility, and a host of other aspects of organizational design and management, but. this construct has never been Clearly conceptualized and measured. This paper introduces the concept of sequential variety which accounts for variability in the sequence of events or actions that make up a process. This paper also proposes and compares three measures of sequential variety in organizational processes: Average distance (based on optimal string matching), algorithmic complexity, and deviation from uniform, random Markov. These measures are compared and validated using a simulated data set that embodies the range of variation likely to be encountered in empirical studies. All. three measures correlate well and provide useful indicators of sequential variety, but. the measures based on optimal string matching, and deviation from the uniform, random Markov seem likely to be more useful in various potential applications.

J	Balasubramanian, S; Konana, P; Menon, NM				Balasubramanian, S; Konana, P; Menon, NM			Customer satisfaction in virtual environments: A study of online investing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						customer satisfaction; electronic markets; marketing strategy; online investing; technology adoption; trust	INTERPERSONAL-TRUST; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; SERVICE QUALITY; DYNAMIC-MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; ORIENTATION; ILLUSION; LOYALTY; SCALE	Many firms are moving to make virtual interfaces their primary, or even sole, points of customer contact In this environment, some traditional service quality dimensions that. determine customer satisfaction, such as the physical appearance of facilities, employees, and equipment, and employees' responsiveness and empathy, are unobservable. In contrast, trust may play a central role here, in enhancing customer satisfaction. We model trust as an endogenously, formed, entity that ultimately impacts customer satisfaction, and we elucidate the linkages between trust and other factors related to the performance of the online service provider, and to the service environment. The model is validated using two samples-one comprising 225 online investors of a large online broker,and the other comprising;03 members of the American Association of Individual Investors,(AAII). The findings suggest that perceived trustworthiness of an online broker is a significant antecedent to investors' satis faction, and. that perceived. environmental security and perceived operational competence impact the formation of trust. The results have important managerial implications.

J	Iyer, AV; Jain, A				Iyer, AV; Jain, A			The logistics impact of a mixture of order-streams in a manufacturer-retailer system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queues with multiple arrival processes; retail promotions; stochastic inventory/production systems	RENEWAL PROCESS; POINT PROCESS; SUPPLY CHAIN; LITTLES LAW; INVENTORY; INFORMATION; QUEUE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DEMAND; MODEL	We model a supply chain with two retail warehouses that place replenishment orders with a common manufacturing capacity. The two,retailers differ in the variability of their order-streams. The order-stream from one retail warehouse is modeled as a Poisson process and from the other as a hyperexponential renewal process. Each retail warehouse uses a base-stock policy to place replenishment orders with, the manufacturer. The manufacturer is modeled as a first-come-first-serve, single exponential server queue. We analyze the supply-side impact of this mixture of order-streams received by the manufacturer on both retailers. An exact analysis of this base-model generates closed-form expressions for distributions of the. lead-time, outstanding orders, and expected inventory. costs for each retailer, and leads to comparative results about the two retailers' performance measures. The base-model is extended to accommodate finished goods at the manufacturer, more than two,, retailers, and bulk-arrivals. We use the model to suggest managerial insights about the impact of the presence of a high-variability retailer on other retailers who share capacity, the distorting impact of manufacturer finished goods inventory on retailer incentives, and the incentives for retailers to participate in variability-reduction programs in the grocery industry.

In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the benefits from flexibility in multistage supply chains. We find two phenomena, stage-spanning bottlenecks and floating bottlenecks, neither of which are present in single-stage supply chains, which reduce the effectiveness of a flexibility configuration. We. develop a flexibility measure g,and show that increasing this measure results in,greater protection from these supply-chain inefficiencies. We also identify flexibility guidelines that perform very well for multistage supply chains. These guidelines employ and adapt the single-stage chaining strategy of Jordan and Graves (1995) to multistage supply chains.

Recently proposed dynamical system models quantify indirect risks due to secondary transmission, in addition to primary infection risk from the water supply considered by standard assessments. Unfortunately, key parameters that influence water treatment policy are unknown, in part because of lack of data and effective inference methods. This paper develops inference methods for those parameters by using stochastic process models to better incorporate infection dynamics into the inference process. Our use of endemic data provides an alternative to waiting for, identifying; and measuring an outbreak. Data both from: simulations and from New York City illustrate the approach.

J	Ryall, MD				Ryall, MD			Subjective rationality, self-confirming equilibrium, and corporate strategy	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						subjective rationality; self-confirming; equilibrium; strategy; persistent advantage	REPEATED GAMES	This paper presents a formal theory of subjective rationality and demonstrates its application to corporate strategy. An agent is said to be subjectively rational when decisions are consistent with the available facts and, where these are lacking, with the agent's own subjective assessments. A self-confirming equilibrium arises when agents' subjectively rational actions generate events that are consistent with their own expectations. Equilibrium strategies may be suboptimal because certain counterfactual beliefs may be erroneous and yet fail to be contradicted by events observed in equilibrium. This weakening of the stronger rationality assumptions inherent in many of the more familiar equilibrium ideas appears well suited to applications in strategy. In particular, performance advantage may be sustained by a firm when its subjectively rational competitors persistently employ suboptimal self-confirming strategies.

Let n = \P\, m = \Q\, and U be the largest magnitude in the lower and upper bounds of variables. We call this problem the convex cost integer dual network flow problem. In this paper, we describe several applications of the convex cost integer dual network flow problem arising in a dial-a-ride transit problem, inverse spanning tree problem, project management and regression analysis. We develop network flow-based algorithms to solve the convex cost integer dual network flow problem. We show that using the Lagrangian relaxation technique, the convex cost integer dual network flow problem can be transformed into a convex cost primal network flow problem where each cost function is a piecewise linear convex function with integer slopes. Its special structure allows the convex cost primal network flow problem to be solved in O(nm log(n(2)/m)log(nU)) time. This time bound is the same time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem using the cost-scaling algorithm, and is also is best available time bound to solve the convex cost integer dual network flow problem.

J	Ioffe, ID; Prisman, EZ				Ioffe, ID; Prisman, EZ			Term structure of interest rates and implied market frictions: The min-max approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						arbitrage; term structure; interest rates; implied market functions; min-max		It is often assumed that financial markets are frictionless. Bond markets are illiquid and bond prices are observed with errors. The magnitude of these errors leads to violation of no-arbitrage conditions and, consequently, prevents researchers from obtaining an estimate of the term structure (TS) of interest rates. Researchers have had to settle for a second-best estimate of the TS (e.g., obtained via regression) at a cost of an economically unrealistic assumption of symmetric market frictions. The true shape of market frictions, however, is not known and generally is a highly complex issue. A no-arbitrage-based methodology that avoids making detrimental assumptions is developed here. It facilitates empirical investigation of the shape of the market frictions and of the TS that are simultaneously imputed from market data assuming "efficient" market frictions that minimize the maximum net arbitrage. The empirical investigation performed in the Canadian and U.S. markets shows that in both markets the frictions are asymmetric and the estimates of the TS produced via regression and our methodology significantly differ.

J	Deshpande, V; Cohen, MA; Donohue, K				Deshpande, V; Cohen, MA; Donohue, K			A threshold inventory rationing policy for service-differentiated demand classes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory rationing; service differentiation; military application	COMPONENT COMMONALITY; YIELD MANAGEMENT; LEVEL MEASURES; LOST SALES; NO-SHOWS; MODEL; SYSTEM; STOCK; CONVEXITY; ARRIVALS	Motivated by a study of the logistics systems used to manage consumable service parts for the U.S. military, we consider a static threshold-based rationing policy that is useful when pooling inventory across two demand classes characterized by different arrival rates and shortage (stockout and delay) costs. The scheme operates as a (Q, r) policy with the following feature. Demands from both classes are filled on a first-come-first-serve basis as long as on-hand inventory lies above a threshold level K. Once on-hand inventory falls below this level, low-priority (i.e., low shortage cost) demand is backordered while high-priority demand continues to be filled. We analyze this static policy first under the assumption that backorders are filled according to a special threshold clearing mechanism. Structural results for the key performance measures are established to enable an efficient solution algorithm for computing stock control and rationing parameters (i.e., Q, r, and K). Numerical results confirm that the solution under this special threshold clearing mechanism closely approximates that of the priority clearing policy. We next highlight conditions where our policy offers significant savings over traditional "round-up" and "separate stock" policies encountered in the military and elsewhere. Finally, we develop a lower bound on the cost of the optimal rationing policy. Numerical results show that the performance gap between our static threshold policy and the optimal policy is small in environments typical of the military and high-technology industries.

In this paper, we propose a new approach, called "demand reshape," to take advantage of the risk-pooling effect. It is demonstrated that a company can improve its profit by encouraging some of its customers, who intended to purchase one product to switch to another. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated in various scenarios and found to be very promising.

J	Vairaktarakis, GL				Vairaktarakis, GL			The value of resource flexibility in the resource-constrained job assignment problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						resource management; flexibility; integer programming optimization; heuristics	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; BRANCH; MAKESPAN; NETWORKS	We consider the problem of minimizing project duration in an environment where each project activity can be executed by a number of different flexible resources. The capabilities of the flexible resources are modeled using a binary activity-resource matrix A called the availability matrix. Activity durations are known deterministically. We develop tight lower bounds and a variety of heuristics accompanied with extensive computational tests regarding their performance. It is shown that our algorithms consistently perform near optimally. Using these heuristics, we perform experiments on the effect of operating flexibility on project duration, where resource flexibility is measured by the number of resources available per activity, and the form of the availability matrix A. Our experiments lead to important managerial guidelines regarding the role of resource flexibility on project duration. For instance, it is found that when the flexible capabilities of the resources are evenly distributed across the activities, small improvements in resource flexibilities provide nearly the same benefits in project duration as a system of fully flexible resources.

J	Mihm, J; Loch, C; Huchzermeier, A				Mihm, J; Loch, C; Huchzermeier, A			Problem-solving oscillations in complex engineering projects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; engineering projects; complexity; oscillations; control theory; random matrix theory	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; RUGGED LANDSCAPES; DESIGN; INNOVATION; STRATEGIES; SUCCESS; UNCERTAINTY; DECISION; SYSTEMS; TIME	Coordination among many interdependent actors in complex product development projects is recognized as a key activity in organizational theory. It is well known that this coordination becomes progressively more difficult with project size, but we do not yet sufficiently understand whether this effect can be controlled with frequent and rich communication among project members, or whether it is inevitable. Recent work in complexity theory suggests that a project might form a "rugged landscape," for which performance deterioration with system size is inevitable. This paper builds a mathematical model of a complex design project that is divided into components (subproblems) and integrated back to the system. The model explicitly represents local component decisions, as well as component interactions in determining system performance. The model shows, first, how a rugged performance landscape arises even from simple components with simple performance functions, if the components are interdependent. Second, we characterize the dynamic behavior of the system analytically and with simulations. We show under which circumstances it exhibits performance oscillations or divergence to design solutions with low performance. Third, we derive classes of managerial actions available to improve performance dynamics, such as modularization, immediate communication, and exchanging preliminary information. Some of these have not yet received adequate attention in literature and practice.

J	Rosenkopf, L; Almeida, P				Rosenkopf, L; Almeida, P			Overcoming local search through alliances and mobility	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						knowledge; alliances; mobility; patents; localization	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY; GEOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; REGIONAL NETWORKS; PRODUCT-MARKET; KNOWLEDGE; FIRMS; INNOVATION; SPILLOVERS	Recent research suggests that, due to organizational and relational constraints, firms are limited contextually-both geographically and technologically-in their search for new knowledge. But distant contexts may offer ideas and insights that can be extremely useful to innovation through knowledge recombination. So how can firms reach beyond their existing contexts in their search for new knowledge? In this paper, we suggest that two mechanisms-alliances and the mobility of inventors-can serve as bridges to distant contexts and, thus, enable firms to overcome the constraints of contextually localized search. Through the analysis of patent citation patterns in the semiconductor industry, we first demonstrate both the geographic and technological localization of knowledge. We then explore if the formation of alliances and mobility of active inventors facilitate interfirm knowledge flows across contexts. We find that mobility is associated with interfirm knowledge flows regardless of geographic proximity and, in fact, the usefulness of alliances and mobility increases with technological distance. These findings suggest that firms can employ knowledge acquisition mechanisms to fill in the holes of their existing technological and geographic context.

J	Harter, DE; Slaughter, SA				Harter, DE; Slaughter, SA			Quality improvement and infrastructure activity costs in software development: A longitudinal analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	62nd Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Management	AUG 09-11, 2002	DENVER, CO	Acad Management		infrastructure activity costs; software product development; software process improvement; software quality; capability maturity model; organizational inertia	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; INERTIA; MATURITY; SYSTEMS	This study draws upon theories of task interdependence and organizational inertia to analyze the effect of quality improvement on infrastructure activity costs in software development. Although increasing evidence indicates that quality improvement reduces software development costs, the impact on infrastructure activities is not known. Infrastructure activities include services like computer operations, data integration, and configuration management that support software development. Because infrastructure costs represent a substantial portion of firms' information technology budgets, it is important to identify innovations that yield significant cost savings in infrastructure activities. We evaluate quality and cost data collected in nine infrastructure activity centers over 10 years of product development in a major software firm undergoing a quality transformation. Findings indicate that infrastructure activities do benefit from quality improvement. The greatest marginal cost savings are realized in infrastructure activities that are highly interdependent with development and that occur later in the software development life cycle. Organizational inertia influences the rapidity with which the infrastructure activities benefit from higher product quality, especially for the more specialized activities. Finally, our findings suggest that although the savings in infrastructure from quality improvement are substantial, there are diminishing returns to quality improvement in infrastructure activities.

J	Kim, PH				Kim, PH			When private beliefs shape collective reality: The effects of beliefs about coworkers on group discussion and performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						group; information sharing; perception; competence; motivation	DECISION-MAKING GROUPS; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; COORDINATION; JUDGMENT; IMPACT	The study presented in this paper examines how beliefs about coworkers affect group discussion and performance. Two beliefs are considered: (1) Perceptions of coworker task competence, and (2) achievement motivation. This study investigates whether these perceptions can actually hinder group discussion and performance, and considers the contexts in which these detrimental effects are more or less likely to arise. Results indicate that although perceptions of higher achievement motivation in coworkers lowered performance when task information was partially shared, they raised performance when task information was fully shared. A content analysis of group discussions reveals that the discussion behaviors examined by this study, rather than the more frequently examined bias toward discussing common information, mediated these results.

J	Haxholdt, C; Larsen, ER; van Ackere, A				Haxholdt, C; Larsen, ER; van Ackere, A			Mode locking and chaos in a deterministic queueing model with feedback	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						deterministic queueing; simulation; mode locking; chaos	SERVICE FACILITY; CONGESTION; SYSTEMS; BIFURCATION; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR; TOLLS; NOISE	We consider a simple, deterministic queueing system with feedback, which exhibits the phenomena of sustained oscillation, mode locking, quasi-periodic behaviour, and chaos. This implies that a fully deterministic queueing system can exhibit seemingly unpredictable behaviour. We ignore variability, and focus on two forms of feedback: (i) the service rate increases as queue length increases, and (ii) the arrival rate depends on customers' perception of past waiting times. We model a customer's decision to seek service as a two-stage process: (i) deciding whether or not to use a facility, and (ii) deciding the frequency of visit (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This frequency is initially constant, and later on replaced by a deterministic, time-dependent pattern. Although highly stylised, this model captures the essential features of many real-life systems whose average arrival rate varies over time. Reducing the amplitude of cycles in demand makes the system more predictable and thus easier to manage.

Although this approach to the measurement of power has been known for a long time, its application to large games has been limited by the difficulty of computing these indices. This paper presents a new method for computing power indices that combines exact methods with an approximate method due to Owen. This method is of most utility in situations where the number of players is large and the voting weights are concentrated in the hands of a small number of members.

We investigate how the communication configuration affects a three-person coalition negotiation. Restricting who can communicate with whom strongly influences outcomes, and not always in ways that current theory anticipates. Competitive frictions, including a tendency to communicate offers privately, appear to shape much of what we observe. Our results suggest that parties with weaker alternatives would benefit from a more constrained structure, especially if they can be the conduit of communication, while those endowed with stronger alternatives would do well to work within a more public communication structure that promotes competitive bidding.

J	Huckman, RS				Huckman, RS			The utilization of competing technologies within the firm: Evidence from cardiac procedures	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technological choice; competing innovation; technological status; intrafirm groups	CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY; PHYSICIAN RESPONSE; MARKET-STRUCTURE; BYPASS-SURGERY; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; VOLUME; ADOPTION; INDUSTRY	This paper examines the role of technological status in determining the rates at which competing techniques are used within a firm. Consistent with prior studies, technological status is measured on the basis of an actor's prior contributions to the body of knowledge concerning a given technique. The empirical analysis considers two treatments for coronary artery disease (CAD), each of which is associated with a distinct professional group within a hospital. These two groups are often characterized as engaging in a "turf war" for patients. After controlling for several factors that might explain technological choice-the clinical severity of patients, the relative quality of the two procedures at a given facility, firm-level financial performance, and other firm-level characteristics-I find that the technological status of the group associated with each technique affects the relative rate at which it is used within a given hospital. Moreover, this effect is strongest for patients at the margin between the two techniques. These results suggest that viewing the choice between competing innovations as a single, firm-level decision may not always capture the true dynamics underlying such a situation.

J	Shang, KH; Song, JS				Shang, KH; Song, JS			Newsvendor bounds and heuristic for optimal policies in serial supply chains	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory policies; stochastic demand; serial system; closed-form solutions; sensitivity analysis	INVENTORY POLICIES; SYSTEMS; INFORMATION	We consider the classic N-stage serial supply systems with linear costs and stationary random demands. There are deterministic transportation leadtimes between stages, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. The optimal inventory policy for this system is known to be an echelon base-stock policy, which can be computed through minimizing, N nested convex functions recursively. To identify the key determinants, of the optimal policy, we, develop a simple and surprisingly good heuristic. This method minimizes 2N separate newsvendor-type cost functions, each of which uses the original problem data only. These functions are lower and upper bounds for the echelon cost functions; their minimizers form bounds for the optimal echelon base-stock levels. The heuristic is the simple average of the solution bounds. In extensive numerical experiments, the average relative error of the heuristic is 0.24%, with the maximum error less than 1.5%. The bounds and the, heuristic, which can be easily obtained by simple spreadsheet calculations, enhance the accessibility and implementability of the multiechelon inventory theory. More importantly, the closed form expressions provide an analytical tool for us to gain insights into issues such as system bottlenecks, effects of system parameters, and coordination mechanisms in decentralized systems.

J	Goyal, A; Welch, I				Goyal, A; Welch, I			Predicting the equity premium with dividend ratios	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						equity premium; stock returns; dividend yield; out-of-sample prediction	EXPECTED RETURNS; ASSET ALLOCATION; STOCK RETURNS; YIELDS; PREDICTABILITY; TESTS	Our paper suggests a simple, recursive residuals (out-of-sample) graphical approach to evaluating the predictive power of popular equity premium and stock market time-series forecasting regressions.. When applied, we find that dividend ratios should have been known to have no predictive ability even prior to the 1990s, and that any seeming ability even then was driven by only two years, 1973 and 1974. Our paper also documents changes in the time-series processes of the dividends themselves and shows that an increasing persistence of dividend-price ratio is largely responsible for the inability of dividend ratios to predict equity premia. Cochrane's (1997) accounting identity-that dividend ratios have to predict long-run dividend growth or stock returns-empirically holds only over horizons longer than 5-10 years. Over shorter horizons, dividend yields primarily forecast themselves.

J	Kalra, A; Shi, M; Srinivasan, K				Kalra, A; Shi, M; Srinivasan, K			Salesforce compensation scheme and consumer inferences	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						consumer satisfaction; salesforce compensation; signaling; sales assistance	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; SIGNALING QUALITY; PERSPECTIVE; PERCEPTIONS; INCENTIVES; COSTS; AGENT	We investigate the salesforce compensation strategy of a firm selling products in a category that several consumers find technically sophisticated, such as electronics or financial products with legal fine print. Consumers are unable to judge the value difference between a baseline product and a product upgrade with add-on features. While the firm and the salespeople are informed of the value of these features, consumers are uncertain. Thus consumers have to rely on sales assistance to evaluate alternatives. The salesperson decision variables include selling effort and whether to "oversell" the consumer by overclaiming the value of added features. Because sales revenue depends on both the salesperson's selling effort and consumers' valuation of the added features, the salesforce incentive scheme (which can consist of salary, sales commission, or consumer satisfaction-based commission) may induce the short-term oriented salesperson to misrepresent the value of the upgrade. Exaggeration of the value of the added features, however, results in reduced satisfaction levels leading to lower profits for the firm. We show that a salesperson selling products where the value of the upgrade is low prefers to make higher claims when the sales commission rate is sufficiently high. We conjecture that consumers aware of the incentive structure facing the salesperson expect the true value of the add-on feature to be lower than the claimed value. We study the optimal compensation scheme of a firm, which has to communicate her true type and retain its salesforce credibility. We identify the conditions under which a high-upgrade-type firm indicates its true value by altering sales commission rate and satisfaction-based commission rate.

J	Elmaghraby, W				Elmaghraby, W			The importance of ordering in sequential auctions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auctions; sequential; vickrey; procurement	MULTIUNIT DEMANDS; MULTIPLE	To date, the largest part of literature on multi-unit auctions has assumed that there are k homogeneous objects being auctioned, where each bidder wishes to win exactly one or all of k units. These modeling assumptions have made the examination of ordering in sequential auctions inconsequential. The aim of this paper is to introduce and highlight the critical influence that ordering can have on the efficiency of an auction. We study a buyer who outsources via sequential 2nd-price auctions two heterogeneous jobs, and faces a diverse set of suppliers with capacity constraints.

J	Song, J; Almeida, P; Wu, G				Song, J; Almeida, P; Wu, G			Learning-by-hiring: When is mobility more likely to facilitate interfirm knowledge transfer?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						learning-by-hiring; engineer mobility; knowledge transfer	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EMPIRICAL-TEST; LOCAL SEARCH; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; LOCALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; SPILLOVERS	To investigate the conditions under which learning-by-hiring (or the acquisition of knowledge through the hiring of experts from other firms) is more likely, we study the patenting activities of engineers who moved from United States (U.S.) firms to non-U.S. firms. Statistical findings from negative binomial regressions show that mobility is more likely to result in interfirm knowledge transfer when (1) the hiring firm is less path dependent, (2) the hired engineers possess technological expertise distant from that-of the hiring firm, and (3) the hired engineers work in noncore technological areas in their new firm. In addition, the results support the idea that domestic mobility and international mobility are similarly conducive to learning-by-hiring. Thus, our paper suggests that learning-by-hiring can be useful when hired engineers are used for exploring technologically distant knowledge (rather than for reinforcing existing firm expertise) and also for extending the hiring firm's geographic reach.

J	Gittelman, M; Kogut, B				Gittelman, M; Kogut, B			Does good science lead to valuable knowledge? Biotechnology firms and the evolutionary logic of citation patterns	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						science; citations; patents; scientists; epistemic community; biotechnology	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION; LOCALIZATION; ECONOMICS; NETWORKS	This study looks at the United States biotechnology industry as a community of practice caught between two evolutionary logics by which valuable scientific knowledge and valuable innovations are selected. We analyze the publications and patents of 116 biotechnology firms during the period 1988-1995. In models that link scientific capabilities to patent citations, we show that scientific ideas are not simply inputs into inventions; important scientific ideas and influential patents follow different and conflicting selection logics. Publication, collaboration, and science intensity are associated with patented innovations; however, important scientific papers are negatively associated with high-impact innovations. These results point to conflicting logics between science and innovation, and scientists must contribute to both while inhabiting a single epistemic community. We identify individuals listed on patents and scientific papers and find they effectively integrate science with innovation, leading to more successful innovations. Our findings suggest that the role of the small, research-intensive firm is to create a repository of knowledge; to act as an organizational mechanism to combine the capabilities of versatile scientists within and outside the boundaries of the firm; and to manage the selection of scientific ideas to produce valuable technical innovations.

The core idea behind our framework is that networks shape knowledge transfer and learning processes by creating channels for knowledge trade and reducing the risk of learning. In developing our framework, we elaborate on the knowledge transfer capabilities of different types of social ties, the informational properties of public and private knowledge, and how types of knowledge transfer and forms of learning follow from the networks within which firms embed their exchanges. We conducted fieldwork at Chicago-area banks to examine our framework's plausibility and application to learning in financial lending markets, a setting relevant to most firms. Findings indicate that learning is located not only in actors' cognitions or past experiences, but also in relations among actors, and that viewing learning as a social process helps solve problems regarding knowledge transfer and learning in markets.

We introduce a laboratory paradigm for studying organizational culture that captures several key elements of the phenomenon. In our experiments, we allow subjects in "firms" to develop a culture, and then merge two firms. As, expected, performance decreases following the merging of two laboratory firms. In addition, subjects overestimate the performance of the merged firm and attribute the decrease in performance to members of the other firm rather than to situational difficulties created by conflicting culture.

J	Das, A				Das, A			Knowledge and productivity in technical support work	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technical support; call center; diagnostic problem solving; distributed cognition; knowledge management; log-linear modeling		In this paper, we examine the process of technical support work and the role of knowledge in enhancing the productivity of such work. We develop the concepts of problem-solving tasks and moves to describe technical support work, while using call resolution time and problem escalation as measures of productivity. Using hierarchical log-linear modeling, we establish the link between problem-solving moves and productivity. We find that the mix of moves exercised in technical support strongly depends on the formulation of tasks by those requesting support. Because the formulation of tasks is performed by users, knowledge management initiatives must target users as well as support providers to have the desired impact on productivity.

J	Borgatti, SP; Cross, R				Borgatti, SP; Cross, R			A relational view of information seeking and learning in social networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information; social networks; organizational learning; transactive knowledge	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; TRANSACTIVE MEMORY; GROUP-PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; COMMUNICATION; ORGANIZATIONS; ACCURACY; MODEL; POWER; CENTRALITY	Research in organizational learning has demonstrated processes and occasionally performance implications of acquisition of declarative (know-what) and procedural (know-how) knowledge. However, considerably less attention has been paid to learned characteristics of relationships that affect the decision to seek information from other people. Based on a review of the social network, information processing, and organizational learning literatures, along with the results of a previous qualitative study, we propose a formal model of information seeking in which the probability of seeking information from another person is a function of (1) knowing what that person knows; (2) valuing what that person knows; (3) being able to gain timely access to that person's thinking; and (4) perceiving that seeking information from that person would not be too costly. We also hypothesize that the knowing, access, and cost variables mediate the relationship between physical proximity and information seeking. The model is tested using two separate research sites to provide replication. The results indicate strong support for the model and the mediation hypothesis (with the exception of the cost variable). Implications are drawn for the study of both transactive memory and organizational learning, as well as for management practice.

J	Sorenson, O				Sorenson, O			Interdependence and adaptability: Organizational learning and the long-term effect of integration	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						vertical integration; organizational failure; organizational growth; computer workstations	VERTICAL INTEGRATION; AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; COSTS; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGY	A growing body of research documents the role that organizational learning plays in improving firm performance over time. To date, however, this literature has given limited attention to the effect that the internal structure of the firm c an have on generating differences in these learning rates. This paper focuses on the degree to which interdependence-and in particular one structural characteristic that generates interdependence, vertical integration-affects organizational learning. Firms face a trade-off. In stable environments, vertically integrating severely limits the organization's ability to learn by doing because boundedly rational managers find the optimization of operations difficult when making highly interdependent choices. As the volatility of the environment increases though, integration can facilitate learning-by-doing by buffering activities within the firm from instability in the external environment. Thus, firms with a high degree of interdependence suffer less in these environments. Tests of these hypotheses on the growth and exit rates of computer workstation. manufacturers support this thesis.

J	Thomas-Hunt, MC; Ogden, TY; Neale, MA				Thomas-Hunt, MC; Ogden, TY; Neale, MA			Who's really sharing? Effects of social and expert status on knowledge exchange within groups	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						social status; knowledge exchange; perceived expertise	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; UNSHARED INFORMATION; TRANSACTIVE MEMORY; SHARED INFORMATION; DIAGNOSING GROUPS; GROUP-PERFORMANCE; ROLE ASSIGNMENT; GROUP JUDGMENT; GROUP MEMBERS; BIAS	This study investigated the effects of social status and perceived expertise on the emphasis of unique and shared knowledge within functionally heterogeneous groups. While perceived expertise did not increase the individual's emphasis of their own unique knowledge, perceived experts were more likely than nonexperts to emphasize shared knowledge and other member's unique knowledge contributions. Additionally, socially isolated members participated more in discussions and emphasized more of their unique knowledge than did socially connected members. While unique knowledge contributions increased the positive perception of social isolates, similar unique knowledge contributions decreased the positive perception of socially connected members. Finally, socially connected group members gave greater attention to the unique knowledge contributions of the socially isolated member than to the contributions of their socially connected other, but more favorably evaluated members to whom they were more favorably connected than those to whom they were not. We discuss the implications of our findings for managing knowledge exchange within diverse groups.

J	Sine, WD; Scott, S; Di Gregorio, D				Sine, WD; Scott, S; Di Gregorio, D			The halo effect and technology licensing: The influence of institutional prestige on the licensing of university inventions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						prestige; status; licensing; technology	ACADEMIC RESEARCH; INDUSTRY; PRODUCTIVITY; REPUTATION; POSITIONS; GROWTH; EQUITY; FORMS	Sociologists and organizational theorists have long claimed that the processes of knowledge creation and distribution are fundamentally social. Following in this tradition, we explore the effect of institutional prestige on university technology licensing. Empirically, we examine the influence of university prestige on the annual rate of technology licensing by 102 universities from 1991-1998. We show that institutional prestige increases a university's licensing rate over and above the rate that is explained by the university's past licensing:. performance. Because licensing success positively impacts future invention production, we argue that institutional prestige leads to stratification in the creation and distribution of university-generated knowledge.

J	Menon, T; Pfeffer, J				Menon, T; Pfeffer, J			Valuing internal vs. external knowledge: Explaining the preference for outsiders	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						in-group favoritism; learning; internal competition; knowledge management	MARKET ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION; ACQUISITION; FIRM; CONSEQUENCES; ANTECEDENTS; PERSPECTIVE; COMMITMENT	This paper compares how managers value knowledge from internal and external sources. Although many theories account for favoritism toward insiders, we find that preferences for knowledge obtained from outsiders are also prevalent. Two complementary case studies and survey data from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through which this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1) the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus external competitors, and (2) the availability or scarcity of knowledge-internal knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it appear more special and unique. We conclude by considering some consequences of the external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.

J	Zellmer-Bruhn, ME				Zellmer-Bruhn, ME			Interruptive events and team knowledge acquisition	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						team; knowledge management; knowledge acquisition; routines; interruptions	ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES; TIME; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; FIRM	Interruptions have commonly been viewed as negative and as something for managers to control or limit. In this paper, I explore the relationship between interruptions and acquisition of routines-a form of knowledge-by teams. Recent research suggests that interruptions may play an important role in changing organizational routines, and as such may influence knowledge transfer activities. Results suggest that interruptions influence knowledge transfer effort, and both knowledge transfer effort and interruptions are positively related to the acquisition of new work routines. I conclude with implications for research and practice.

J	Nadler, J; Thompson, L; Van Boven, L				Nadler, J; Thompson, L; Van Boven, L			Learning negotiation skills: Four models of knowledge creation and transfer	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						negotiation; learning; analogical reasoning; management skills	ANALOGICAL TRANSFER; SIMILARITY; JUDGMENT	Our review of the learning and training literature revealed four common methods for training people to be more effective negotiators: didactic learning, learning via information revelation, analogical learning, and observational learning. We tested each of these methods experimentally in an experiential context and found that observational learning and analogical learning led to negotiated outcomes that were more favorable for both parties, compared to a baseline condition of learning through experience alone. Information revelation and didactic learning were not significantly different from any other condition. Process measures revealed that negotiators' schemas about the task (reflected in open-ended essays) were strong predictors of performance in the analogical learning condition, but were poor predictors of performance in the remaining conditions. Interestingly, negotiators in the observation group showed the largest increase in performance, but the least ability to articulate the learning principles that helped them improve, suggesting that they had acquired tacit knowledge that they were unable to articulate.

J	Chang, MH; Harrington, JE				Chang, MH; Harrington, JE			Multimarket competition, consumer search, and the organizational structure of multiunit firms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decentralization; market structure; adaptation; spillovers		This research explores how market competition influences a firm's optimal organizational structure. For this purpose, a computational model of competing multiunit firms is developed in which unit managers and corporate staff continually search for better practices, while consumers search among units to find a better match. Organizational structure impacts both the practices at the unit level and the extent of knowledge transfer. An increasing returns mechanism is identified, which results in the relative performance of the centralized form being greater when competition is more intense.

In particular, this study is motivated by the divergent evolutions of the PC and the workstation markets in response to a new technology: reduced instruction set computing (RISC). In the PC market, Intel has developed new microprocessors by maintaining compatibility with the established architecture, whereas it was radically replaced by RISC in the workstation market. History indicates that unlike the PC market, the workstation market consisted of a large number of power users, who are less sensitive to compatibility than ordinary users. Our numerical analysis indicates that the exploration of a new, incompatible technology is more likely to increase the chance of firm growth when there are a substantial number of power users or when a new technology is introduced before an established technology takes off.

J	Argote, L; McEvily, B; Reagans, R				Argote, L; McEvily, B; Reagans, R			Managing knowledge in organizations: An integrative framework and review of emerging themes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						knowledge management; organizational learning; knowledge transfer; innovation; organizational memory	DEVELOPMENT TEAMS; GROUP-PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; CAPABILITIES; MEMORY; PERSISTENCE; ACQUISITION; DIVERSITY; NETWORKS; INDUSTRY	In this concluding article to the Management Science special issue on "Managing Knowledge in Organizations: Creating, Retaining, and Transferring Knowledge," we provide an integrative framework for organizing the literature on knowledge management. The framework has two dimensions. The knowledge management outcomes of knowledge creation, retention, and transfer are represented along one dimension. Properties of the context within which knowledge management occurs are represented on the other dimension. These properties, which affect knowledge management outcomes, can be organized according to whether they are properties of a unit (e.g., individual, group, organization) involved in knowledge management, properties of relationships between units or properties of the knowledge itself. The framework is used to identify where research findings about knowledge management converge and where gaps in our understanding exist. The article discusses mechanisms of knowledge management and how those mechanisms affect a unit's ability to create, retain and transfer knowledge. Emerging themes in the literature on knowledge management are identified. Directions for future research are suggested.

J	Ozer, O				Ozer, O			Replenishment strategies for distribution systems under advance demand information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic inventory systems; advance demand information; multi-echelon; distribution systems; supply chain management	INVENTORY SYSTEMS; POLICIES; MODEL; APPROXIMATIONS; POSTPONEMENT; FORECASTS; LEADTIMES; DESIGN	Customers with positive demand lead times place orders in advance of their needs. A portfolio of customers with different demand lead times gives rise to what we call advance demand information. We develop effective inventory policies for a distribution system to account for this information. In particular, we study a centralized system with one warehouse serving multiple retailers under advance demand information. The inventory manager replenishes the warehouse from an outside supplier: Units arriving to the warehouse are allocated to the retailers. To control this system, we develop a lower bound and proposed a close-to-optimal heuristic for which the optimality gap is on average 1.92%. We also provide a closed-form solution to approximate the system-wide inventory level. Using this explicit solution, the model and the heuristic, we investigate (1) the benefit of advance demand information, and its impact on allocation decisions, (2) the joint role of risk pooling and advance demand information, and (3) the system performance with respect to supplier and retailer lead times. We illustrate how advance demand information can be a substitute for lead times and inventory, and how it enhances the outcome of delayed differentiation.

J	Devaraj, S; Kohli, R				Devaraj, S; Kohli, R			Performance impacts of information technology: Is actual usage the missing link?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information technology; IT payoff IT usage; healthcare; longitudinal study; profitability; quality	HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY; DECISION-SUPPORT; FIRM PERFORMANCE; ACCEPTANCE MODEL; EQUATION MODEL; BUSINESS VALUE; EMPIRICAL-TEST; SYSTEM-USE; PRODUCTIVITY; PARTICIPATION	The relationship between investment in information technology (IT) and its effect on organizational performance continues to interest academics and practitioners. In many cases, due to the nature of the research design employed, this stream of research has been unable to identify the impact of individual technologies on organizational performance. This study posits that the driver of IT impact is not the investment in the technology, but the actual usage of the technology. This proposition is tested in a longitudinal setting of a healthcare system comprising eight hospitals. Monthly data for a three-year period on various financial and nonfinancial measures of hospital performance and technology usage were analyzed. The data analysis provides evidence for the technology usage-performance link after controlling for various external factors. Technology usage was positively and significantly associated with measures of hospital revenue and quality, and this effect occurred after time lags. The analysis was triangulated using three measures of technology usage. The general support for the principal proposition of this paper that "actual usage" may be a key variable in explaining the impact of technology on performance suggests that omission of this variable may be a missing link in IT payoff analyses.

An agent-based simulation allows us to model three design elements and two contextual variables that have rarely been analyzed jointly: a vertical hierarchy that reviews proposals from subordinates, an incentive system that rewards subordinates for departmental or firm-wide performance, the decomposition of an organization's many decisions into departments, the underlying pattern of interactions among decisions, and limits on the ability of managers to process information. Interdependencies arise among these features because of a basic, general tension. To be successful, an organization must broadly search for good sets of decisions, but it must also stabilize around good decisions once discovered. An effective organization balances search and stability. We identify sets of design elements that encourage broad search and others that promote stability. The adoption of elements that encourage broad search typically raises the marginal benefit of other elements that provide offsetting stability. Hence, the need to balance search and stability generates interdependencies among the design elements. We pay special attention to interdependencies that involve the vertical hierarchy. Our findings confirm :many aspects of conventional wisdom about vertical hierarchies, but challenge or put boundary conditions on others. We place limits, for instance, on the received wisdom that firm-wide incentives and capable subordinates make top-level oversight less valuable. We also identify circumstances in which vertical hierarchies can lead to inferior long-term performance.

J	Baesens, B; Setiono, R; Mues, C; Vanthienen, J				Baesens, B; Setiono, R; Mues, C; Vanthienen, J			Using neural network rule extraction and decision tables for credit-risk evaluation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						credit-risk evaluation; neural networks; decision tables; classification	FEATURE-SELECTION; SCORING MODELS	Credit-risk evaluation is a very challenging and important management science problem in the domain of financial analysis. Many classification methods have been suggested in the literature to tackle this problem. Neural networks, especially, have received a lot of attention because of their universal approximation property. However, a major drawback associated with the use of neural networks for decision making is their lack of explanation capability. While they can achieve a high predictive accuracy rate, the reasoning behind how they reach their decisions is not readily available. In this paper, we present the results from analysing three real-life credit-risk data sets using neural network rule extraction techniques. Clarifying the neural network decisions by explanatory rules that capture the learned knowledge embedded in the networks can help the credit-risk manager in explaining why a particular applicant is classified. as either bad or good. Furthermore, we also discuss how these rules can be visualized as a decision table in a compact and intuitive graphical format that facilitates easy consultation. It is concluded that neural network rule extraction and decision tables are powerful management tools that allow us to build advanced and user-friendly decision-support systems for credit-risk evaluation.

In resource-constrained project scheduling, the jobs additionally compete for scarce resources. Due to its universality, the latter problem has a variety of applications in manufacturing, production planning, project management, and elsewhere. It is one of the most intractable problems in operations research, and has therefore become a popular playground for the latest optimization techniques, including virtually all local search paradigms. We show that a somewhat more classical mathematical programming approach leads to both competitive feasible solutions and strong lower bounds, within reasonable computation times. The basic ingredients of our approach are the Lagrangian relaxation of a time-indexed integer programming formulation and relaxation-based list scheduling, enriched with a useful idea from recent approximation algorithms for machine scheduling problems. The efficiency of the algorithm results from the insight that the relaxed problem can be solved by computing a minimum cut in an appropriately defined directed graph. Our computational study covers different types of resource-constrained project scheduling problems, based on several notoriously hard test sets, including practical problem instances from chemical production planning.

J	Lee, J				Lee, J			Innovation and strategic divergence: An empirical study of the US pharmaceutical industry from 1920 to 1960	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						innovation; strategic groups; schumpeterian competition	PERFORMANCE; MARKETS	Today, firms employing two distinct survival strategies-(l) innovation and (2) imitation-coexist in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. History indicates that this intraindustry heterogeneity did not exist prior to 1940. This study empirically investigates the origin of this strategic divergence by focusing on changes in firms' R&D inputs and outputs. It finds that some U.S. pharmaceutical firms responded to the opportunity presented by the discovery of antibiotics in the 1940s by investing more in R&D, while many others did not. Over time, the innovators dominated in developing new drugs, and the gap between innovators and imitators steadily increased. These findings also shed light on "the genesis of strategic groups," a phenomenon that is not yet well understood.

J	Raghu, TS; Sen, PK; Rao, HR				Raghu, TS; Sen, PK; Rao, HR			Relative performance of incentive mechanisms: Computational modeling and simulation of delegated investment decisions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						delegated investments; simulation; incentive schemes; risk aversion; agency theory	MORAL HAZARD; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT	This paper evaluates the relative performances of several well-known and widely-used incentive mechanisms under controlled experimental conditions. The scenario utilized is a delegated investment setting where effort and risk aversions contribute to moral hazard among fund managers. Analytical intractability of the problem requires a computational modeling approach to simulate comparative solutions for specific contracts under different parametric settings. Through a simulation exercise, we consider multiple agents who decide their investment strategy over several consecutive periods. Agents learn about estimation and market uncertainty through repeated realizations of investment returns. In each sequence of periods, a number of different incentive mechanisms based on the agent's communication and/or outcome are considered. Results of the computational experiments are presented. Our results overwhelmingly show the efficacy of the incentive contracts in improving the welfare of the investors. In the presence of an estimation risk, when agents learn from their past performances, the market volatility interacts with the estimation risk that makes risk-sharing arrangements such as limited liability overly important. Paying the agent to assume the risk may no longer lead to the best performance incentives.

J	Lee, J; Boatwright, P; Kamakura, WA				Lee, J; Boatwright, P; Kamakura, WA			A Bayesian model for prelaunch sales forecasting of recorded music	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						forecasting; empirical generalization; hierarchical Bayes model	EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS	In a situation where several hundred new music albums are released each month, producing sales forecasts in a reliable and consistent manner is a rather difficult and cumbersome task. The purpose of this study is to obtain sales forecasts for a new album before it is introduced. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model based on a logistic diffusion process. It allows for the generalization of various adoption patterns out of discrete data and can be applied in a situation where the eventual number of adopters is unknown. Using sales of previous albums along with information known prior to the launch of a new album, the model constructs informed priors, yielding prelaunch sales forecasts, which are out-of-sample predictions. In the context of new product forecasting before introduction, the information we have is limited to the relevant background characteristics of a new album. Knowing only the general attributes of a new album, the meta-analytic approach proposed here provides an informed prior on the dynamics of duration, the effects of marketing variables, and the unknown market potential. As new data become available, weekly sales forecasts and market size (number of eventual adopters) are revised and updated. We illustrate our approach using weekly sales data of albums that appeared in Billboard's Top 200 albums chart from January 1994 to December 1995.

J	Bayus, BL; Erickson, G; Jacobson, R				Bayus, BL; Erickson, G; Jacobson, R			The financial rewards of new product introductions in the personal computer industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product introductions; firm value; personal computer industry; empirical analysis	PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; MARKET; PROFITABILITY; RETURNS; FIRMS	Based on data from firms in the personal computer industry, we study the effect of new product introductions on three key drivers of firm value: profit rate, profit-rate persistence, and firm size as reflected in asset growth. Consistent with our theoretical development, we find that new product introductions influence profit rate and size; however, we find no effect on profit-rate persistence. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of new product introductions on profit rate stems from a reduction in selling and general administrative expenditure intensity rather than through an increase in gross operating return. Notably, firms decrease their advertising intensity in the wake of a new product introduction. Firm profitability in this industry apparently benefits from new product introductions because new products need less marketing support than older products.

J	Jin, X; Fu, MC; Xiong, XP				Jin, X; Fu, MC; Xiong, XP			Probabilistic error bounds for simulation quantile estimators	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quantile estimation; simulation; variance reduction; Latin hypercube sampling		Quantile estimation has become increasingly important, particularly in the financial industry, where value at risk (VaR) has emerged as a standard measurement tool for controlling portfolio risk. In this paper, we analyze the probability that a simulation-based quantile estimator fails to lie in a prespecified neighborhood of the true quantile. First, we show that this error probability converges to zero exponentially fast with sample size for negatively dependent sampling. Then we consider stratified quantile estimators and show that the error probability for these estimators can be guaranteed to be 0 with sufficiently large, but finite, sample size. These estimators, however, require sample sizes that grow exponentially in the problem dimension. Numerical experiments on a simple VaR example illustrate the potential for variance reduction.

Unmet demand is back-ordered. Production/transportation times are constant. All deliveries from one stage to the next must be multiples of given batch sizes. We consider the problem of minimizing the holding costs under a fill rate constraint. Using recent results by Chen (2000), we show that under a set of restricted but plausible assumptions, the optimal policy is an echelon stock multistage (R, nQ) policy with one of the reorder points varying over time. We provide a simple procedure for the determination of the optimal policy.

J	Chiang, WYK; Chhajed, D; Hess, JD				Chiang, WYK; Chhajed, D; Hess, JD			Direct-marketing, indirect profits: A strategic analysis of dual-channel supply-chain design	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; channels of distribution; Internet/direct marketing; e-commerce; competitive strategy; game theory	COORDINATION; COMPETITION; RETAILERS	The advent of e-commerce has prompted many-manufacturers to redesign their traditional channel structures by engaging in direct sales. The model conceptualizes the impact-of customer acceptance of a direct channel, the degree to which customers accept a direct channel as a substitute for. shopping at a traditional store, on supply-chain design. The customer acceptance of a direct channel can be strong enough that an indepent manufacturer Would open a direct channel to, compete with its own retailers. Here, direct marketing is used for strategic channel control purposes even though it is inefficient on its own and, surprisingly, it can profit the manufacturer even when so direct sales occur. Specifically, we construct a price-setting game between a manufacturer and its independent retailer. Direct marketing, which indirectly increases the flow of profits through the retail channel, helps the manufacturer improve overall Profitability by reducing the degree of inefficient price double marginalization. While operated by the manufacturer to constrain the retailer's pricing behavior, the direct channel may-not always be detrimental to the retailer because it will be accompanied by a wholesale price reduction. This combination of manufacturer pull and push can benefit the retailer in equilibrium. Finally, we show that the mere threat of introducing the direct channel can increase the manufacturer's negotiated share of cooperative profits even if price efficiency is obtained by using other business practices.

J	Ahuja, MK; Galletta, DF; Carley, KM				Ahuja, MK; Galletta, DF; Carley, KM			Individual centrality and performance in virtual R&D groups: An empirical study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						field study; path analysis; social science; hierarchy of authority; IS project teams; electronic mail; social network analysis; centrality; roles; individual performance	NETWORK CENTRALITY; ELECTRONIC MAIL; SOCIAL-CONTEXT; ORGANIZATIONS; POWER; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; ROLES; TASK; WORK	Communication technologies support virtual R&D groups by enabling immediate and frequent interaction of their geographically-distributed members. Performance of members in such groups has yet to be studied longitudinally. A model proposes not only direct effects of. functional role, status, and communication role on individual performance, but also indirect effects through individual centrality. Social network analysis was performed on e-mail samples from two time periods separated by four years. Analysis revealed both direct and indirect effects as hypothesized; however, the indirect effects were more consistent in both time periods, The clearest findings were that centrality mediates the effects of functional role, status., and communication role on individual performance. Interestingly, centrality was a stronger direct predictor of performance than the individual characteristics considered in this study. The study illustrates the usefulness of accounting for network effects for better understanding individual performance in virtual groups.

However, through contrasting the various learning process theories described in the research on organizational, group, and individual learning, we develop a set of competing hypotheses that suggest some degree of variation might improve the learning rate. Furthermore, such comparison yields competing arguments about how related or unrelated such task variation should be to improve the learning rate. This research uses an experimental study to answer the following research questions: Is the learning rate maximized through specialization? Or does variation, related or unrelated, enhance the learning process? We find that the learning rate under conditions of related variation is significantly greater than under conditions of specialization or unrelated variation, indicating the possibility of synergy between related learning efforts consistent with an implicit learning or insight effect. We find no significant differences in the rates of learning under the conditions of specialization and unrelated variation. These results yield important implications for how work should be organized, and for future research into the learning process.

J	Schwartz, ES; Zozaya-Gorostiza, C				Schwartz, ES; Zozaya-Gorostiza, C			Investment under uncertainty in information technology: Acquisition and development projects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						investment under uncertainity; real options; information technology; acquisition and development projects	REAL OPTIONS	In this paper, we develop two models for the valuation-of information technology (IT) investment projects using the real options approach. The IT investment projects discussed in this paper are categorized into development and acquisition projects, depending upon the time it takes to start benefiting from the IT asset once the decision to invest has been taken. The models account for uncertainty both in the costs and benefits associated with the investment opportunity. Our stochastic cost function for IT development projects incorporates the technical and input cost uncertainties of Pindyck's model (1993), but also considers the fact that the investment costs of some IT projects might change even if no investment takes place. In contrast to other models in the real options literature in which benefits are summarized in the underlying asset value, our model for IT acquisition projects represents these benefits as a stream of stochastic cash flows.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auctions; subsidies; disadvantaged competitors; affirmative action; set-asides; procurement costs	AUCTIONS; PROCUREMENT; BIDS	A widespread practice, particularly in public-sector procurement and dispersal, is to subsidize a class of competitors believed to be at an economic disadvantage. Arguments for such policies vary, but they typically assume that benefits of subsidization must be large enough to outweigh a presumed economic cost of the subsidy. When disadvantaged competitors compete in auctions, the subsidy serves to. make them more competitive rivals. Other bidders rationally respond by bidding more aggressively. We consider a model of procurement auctions and show that a policy of subsidizing inefficient competitors can lower expected project cost and also enhance economic efficiency. Some subsidy is generally better than no subsidy for-a wide range of parameters.

J	Bapna, R; Goes, P; Gupta, A				Bapna, R; Goes, P; Gupta, A			Analysis and design of business-to-consumer online auctions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						online auctions; dynamic pricing; pricing mechanisms		Business-to-consumer online auctions form an important element in the portfolio of mercantile processes that facilitate electronic commerce activity. Much of traditional auction.. theory has focused on analyzing single-item auctions in isolation from the market context in which they take place. We demonstrate the weakness of such approaches in online settings where a majority of auctions are multiunit in nature. Rather than pursuing a classical approach and assuming knowledge of the distribution of consumers' valuations, we emphasize the largely ignored discrete and sequential nature of such auctions. We derive a general expression that characterizes the multiple equilibria that can arise in such auctions and segregate these into desirable and undesirable categories. Our analytical and empirical results,, obtained by tracking real-world online auctions, indicate that bid increment is an important factor amongst the control factors that online auctioneers can manipulate and control. We show that consumer bidding strategies in such auctions-are not-uniform and that the level of bide increment chosen influences them. With a motive of providing concrete strategic directions to online auctioneers, we derive an absolute upper bound for the bid increment. Based on the theoretical upper bound we propose a heuristic decision rule for setting the bid increment. Empirical evidence lends support to the hypothesis that setting a bid increment higher than that suggested by the heuristic decision rule has a negative impact on the auctioneer's revenue.

J	Delquie, P				Delquie, P			Optimal conflict in preference assessment	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						preference modeling; utility assessment; decision analysis; value trade-off; response bias and error	PARAMETER-FREE ELICITATION; ATTRIBUTE CONFLICT; UTILITY-FUNCTIONS; CHOICE; UNCERTAINTY; DECISION; ERROR; TIME	Conflict arises in decision making when the choice alternatives present strong advantages and disadvantages over one another, that is, when the trade-offs involved are large. Conflict affects human response to choice, in particular, it increases decision difficulty and response unreliability. On the other hand, larger trade-offs, i.e., higher conflict, reveal more information about an individual's preferences and mitigate the influence of measurement unreliability on preference model estimation. This suggests, somewhat counterintuitively, that there may exist some optimal level of conflict for efficient measurement of preferences. How to determine this level? This issue is examined from behavioral and analytical angles. We outline a general analysis of the interaction between trade-off size and modeling accuracy, and demonstrate its application on a simple example. The kind of analysis developed here can be conveniently implemented in a computer spreadsheet, and would be especially valuable when large amounts of preference data are to be collected, as in consumer preference studies, experimental research, and contingent valuation surveys.

One player first senda a message indicating an intended play, which is either favorable or unfavorable to the other player in the game. After the message, the sender, and the receiver play a simultaneous 2 x 2 game, in which the sender may or may not play according to his message. Outcome cells may, hence, be reached following true or false messages. In the third stage, the receiver may (at a cost) punish or reward, depending on which cell of the simultaneous game has been reached. We test whether receivers' rates of monetary sacrifice depend on the process by which an outcome is reached. We study two decision-elicitation methods: the strategy and the direct response methods. For each method, deception more than doubles the punishment rate as a response to an action that is unfavorable to the receiver. We also find evidence that 17-25% of all participants choose to reward a favorable action choice made by the sender, even though doing so leaves one at a payoff disadvantage.

J	Heikkinen, VP				Heikkinen, VP			Timber harvesting as a part of the portfolio management: A multiperiod stochastic optimisation approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						timber harvesting; stochastic optimisation; cointegration	PRICES; COINTEGRATION; OPTIMIZATION; INVESTMENTS; RETURNS; PERIOD; RISK	A multiperiod stochastic optimization model is formulated for a land owner who can speculate between investing harvesting income in financial assets and postponing harvesting. This paper demonstrates the benefits from using a multiperiod model, the effects of cointegration on optimal portfolio, and the differences between the timber harvesting model and the standard financial portfolio optimisation model. The demonstrations are made partly by using a real Finnish forest and price data, and partly by using artificial data. In the real data example, the system is demonstrated using a case where it is assumed that the land owner has several mature forest stands, which can be harvested at any time during the next 3 years. Investment alternatives are stocks, government bonds, and bank deposits. The forestry returns were defined as a sum of exponential physical growth and stumpage price return. The chosen definition of forestry returns makes the model very useful, for example, when speculating on what speed of physical growth is needed to make forestry a competitive investment alternative when both returns and risks are considered.

J	Ingram, P; Simons, T				Ingram, P; Simons, T			The transfer of experience in groups of organizations: Implications for performance and competition	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	59th Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Management	AUG, 1999	CHICAGO, IL	Acad Management		learning curve; knowledge sharing; profitability; agriculture; Kibbutz; groups	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; BUSINESS GROUPS; NETWORKS; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; KIBBUTZ; DESIGN; JAPAN	Groups of organizations are pervasive, although there is little systematic knowledge about how they affect their members. We examine one dimension of the operation of organization groups, the transfer of experience. Our Fore,argument is that organization groups may create benefits for their members, but problems-for those outside the group. Within the group they can facilitate the transfer of experience among their members by creating mechanisms for communication, incentives for helping, and by promoting, understanding. The predicted pattern of experience transfer should improve performance of those within the group, but also has implications for those outside it. Experience accumulated, in one organization group strengthens the competitiveness of its organizations, and thereby harms competitors outside the group. Thus, organization groups are fundamental both for the functioning of their members and the competitive dynamics of their industries. Our longitudinal analysis of the profitability of kibbutz agriculture supports both these claims. Between 1954 and 1965 (the years of this study), almost all kibbutzim were part of organization groups. Kibbutzim became more profitable as a function of the experience of others in their group was reduced, however, as a function of experience of others outside. their Their profitability group.

J	Chung, W; Alcacer, J				Chung, W; Alcacer, J			Knowledge seeking and location choice of foreign direct investment in the United States	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FDI; location choice; knowledge seeking; random parameter logit	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; GLOBALIZATION; LOCALIZATION; CAPABILITIES; ENDOGENEITY; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTORS; INDUSTRY; STRATEGY; FIRM	To what extent do firms go abroad to access technology available in other locations? This paper examines whether and when state technical capabilities attract foreign investment in manufacturing from. 1987-1993. We find that on average state R&D intensity does not attract foreign direct investment. Most investing firms are in lower-tech industries and locate in low R&D intensity states, suggesting little interest in state technical capabilities. In contrast, we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R&D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R&D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R&D intensive states. This suggests that beyond catching up, firms use knowledge-seeking investments also to source technical diversity.

J	Anderson, RM; Hobbs, BF				Anderson, RM; Hobbs, BF			Using a Bayesian approach to quantify scale compatibility bias	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multicriteria decision making; additive multiattribute value model; Bayesian linear regression; scale compatibility bias; random error; multiattribute weight	MULTIATTRIBUTE UTILITY MEASUREMENT; DECISION QUALITY; PREFERENCE; CONSTRUCTION; WEIGHTS; MODELS	his paper proposes a new analytical framework to quantify and correct for scale compatibility bias in the assessment of trade-off weights in multiattribute value analysis. The procedure is demonstrated with an application to a fisheries management problem. Tradeoff judgments are elicited from a group of fisheries experts with management responsibility in the Lake Erie basin. Then we use a Bayesian method to compute posterior probability distributing of attribute weights. In computing the Bayesian weights, our measurement model assumes that the weight ratios produced by each respondent's judgments are subject to random error and an unknown scale compatibility bias. Ratios are log-transformed and analyzed by a Bayesian linear model with a noninformative prior distribution. Posterior distributions are then developed for the weights and the bias. We estimate the compatibility bias for each person and, in most cases, it is found to be large and in the predicted direction, suggesting the importance of its consideration in deriving trade-off weights. In addition, the Bayesian framework is shown to be useful for quantifying the value of additional information about multiattribute weights.

J	Steiger, NM; Wilson, JR				Steiger, NM; Wilson, JR			An improved batch means procedure for simulation output analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; statistical analysis; method of batch means; steady-state output analysis	W TEST; NORMALITY	We formulate and evaluate the Automated Simulation Analysis Procedure (ASAP), an algorithm for steady-state simulation output analysis based on the method of nonoverlapping batch means (NOBM). ASAP delivers a confidence interval for an expected response that is centered on the sample mean of a portion of a simulation-generated time series and satisfies a user-specified absolute or relative precision requirement. ASAP operates as follows: The batch size is progressively increased until either (a) the batch means pass the von Neumann test for independence, and then ASAP delivers a classical NOBM confidence interval; or (b) the batch means pass the Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality, and then ASAP delivers a correlation-adjusted confidence interval. The latter adjustment is based on an inverted Cornish-Fisher expansion for the classical NOBM t-ratio, where the terms of the expansion are estimated via an autoregressive-moving average time series model of the batch means. After determining the batch size and confidence-interval type, ASAP sequentially increases the number of batches until the precision requirement is satisfied. An extensive experimental study demonstrates the performance improvements achieved by ASAP versus well-known batch means procedures, especially in confidence-interval coverage probability.

J	Wolsey, LA				Wolsey, LA			Solving multi-item lot-sizing problems with an MIP solver using classification and reformulation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lot sizing; production planning; classification; convex hull; extended formulation; mixed-integer programming	WAGNER-WHITIN COSTS; START-UP COSTS; MIXED-INTEGER PROGRAMS; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; VALID INEQUALITIES; MODELS; FORMULATION; ALGORITHMS	Based on research on the polyhedral structure of lot-sizing models over the last 20 years, we claim that there is a nontrivial fraction of practical lot-sizing problems that can now be solved by nonspecialists just by taking an appropriate a priori reformulation of the problem, and then feeding the resulting formulation into a commercial mixed-integer programming solver. This claim uses the fact that many multi-item problems decompose naturally into a set of single-item problems with linking constraints, and that there is now a large body of knowledge about single-item problems. To put this knowledge to use, we propose a classification of lot-sizing problems (in large part single-item) and then indicate in a set of tables, what is known about a particular problem class and how useful it might be. Specifically, we indicate for each class (i) whether a tight extended. formulation is known, and its size; (ii) whether one or more families of valid inequalities are known defining the convex hull of solutions, and the complexity of the corresponding separation algorithms; and (iii) the complexity of the corresponding optimization algorithms (which would be useful if a column generation or Lagrangian relaxation approach was envisaged). Three distinct multi-item lot-sizing instances are then presented to demonstrate the approach, and comparative computational results are presented. Finally, we also use the classification to point out what appear to be some of the important open questions and challenges.

The multiobjective knapsack problem is a generalization of the classical knapsack problem in which each item has several profit values. For this problem, efficient algorithms for computing a provably good approximation to the set of all nondominated feasible solutions, the Pareto frontier, are studied. For the multiobjective one-dimensional knapsack problem, a practical fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) is derived. It is based on a new approach to the single objective knapsack problem using a partition of the profit space into intervals of exponentially increasing length. For the multiobjective m-dimensional knapsack problem, the first known polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), based on linear programming, is presented.

Prior studies have shown that perturbation methods are effective in protecting such confidential data from snoopers. Perturbation methods have to provide legitimate users. with accurate (unbiased) information, and also provide adequate security against disclosure of confidential information to snoopers. For databases described by nonnormal multivariate distributions, existing perturbation methods do not provide unbiased characteristics. In this study, we develop a copula-based perturbation method capable of maintaining the marginal distribution of perturbed attributes to be the same before and after perturbation. In addition, this method also preserves the rank order correlation between the confidential and nonconfidential attributes, thereby maintaining monotonic relationships between attributes. The method proposed in this study provides a high level of protection, against inferential disclosure. An investigation of the new perturbation method for simulated databases shows that the method performs effectively The methodology presented in this study represents a significant step toward improving the practical. applicability of data perturbation methods.

J	Masuda, Y; Whang, S				Masuda, Y; Whang, S			Capacity management in decentralized networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bottleneck analysis; Braess's paradox; Nash equilibrium; externality pricing; queueing network		Bottleneck analysis is a useful tool in capacity planning for centrally controlled network systems. However, under a decentralized network where individual users are allowed to select their own routes, straightforward application of bottleneck analysis does not necessarily yield an optimal performance. It may even hurt the system performance-an aspect of Braess's paradox. We investigate the capacity expansion problem for a decentralized system with general network topology. To this end, we first discuss the short-run problem and show that the, externality pricing solves the joint problem of demand and routing control. We then study the capacity expansion/reduction problem for decentralized systems that may or may not be optimally controlled in the short run.

The 'problem may arise in a rush-order application at a bank branch where the emergency provision costs during a foreign currency stockout are represented by proportional and lump-sum penalties. Aneja and Noori (1987) analyzed this problem and presented a set of conditions for the convexity of a particular function and made a claim about the K-convexity of another function to prove the optimality of the (s, S) policy. We show that because the function that is claimed to be K-convex is actually concave over a subset of its domain, Aneja and Noori' arguments cannot be used to prove the optimality of the (s, S) policy. However, we argue that Aneja and Noori's problem is equivalent to the typical lost-sales problem, and using this equivalence, we find a simple convexity. condition that assures the optimality of the (s, S) policy.

This note provides a high-level but self-contained summary of the revised results. We find that, in contrast with the earlier claim, guaranteed auctions lead to-greater total expected revenue than conventional auctions. The ability to bargain over guarantee values and commissions certainly benefits sellers but may hurt the profits of auction houses. We relate these results to recent events in auction markets.

J	Lovejoy, WS; Li, Y				Lovejoy, WS; Li, Y			Hospital operating room capacity expansion	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; MODELS; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; SERVICE; HYBRID	A large midwestern hospital is expecting an increase in, surgical caseload: New operating, room (OR) capacity can be had by building new ORs or extending the working hours in the current ORs. The choice among these options is complicated by the fact that patients; surgeons and, surgical staff, and hospital administrators are all important stakeholders in: the health service operation, and each has different priorities. This. paper investigates the trade-offs among three performance criteria (wait to get on schedule, scheduled procedure start-tune reliability; and hospital profits), which are of particular importance to the different constituencies. The objective is to determine how the hospital can best expand its capacity, acknowledging the key role that each constituency plays in that objective. En route, the paper presents supporting analysis for process improvements and suggestions for. optimal participation-inducing staff contracts for extending OR hours-of operation.

J	Vulcano, G; van Ryzin, G; Maglaras, C				Vulcano, G; van Ryzin, G; Maglaras, C			Optimal dynamic auctions for revenue management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						optimal auction; strategic behavior; revenue management; dynamic programming; mechanism design	AIRLINE SEAT ALLOCATION; FARE CLASSES; INVENTORY CONTROL; DEMAND; MODEL	We analyze a dynamic auction, in which a seller, with C units to sell faces a sequence of buyers separated into T time periods. Each group of buyers has independent, private values for a single unit. Buyers compete directly against each other within a period, as in a traditional auction, and indirectly with buyers in other periods through the opportunity cost of capacity assessed by the seller. The number of buyers in each period, as well as the individual buyers' valuations, are random. The model is a variation of the traditional singleleg, multiperiod revenue management problem, in which consumers act strategically and bid for units of a fixed capacity over time. For this setting, we prove that dynamic variants of the first-price and second-price auction mechanisms maximize the seller's expected revenue. We also show explicitly how to compute and implement these optimal auctions. The optimal auctions are then compared to a traditional revenue management mechanism-in which list prices are used in each period together with capacity controls-and, to a simple auction heuristic that consists of allocating units to each period and running a sequence of standard, multiunit auctions with fixed reserve prices in each period. The traditional revenue management mechanism is proven to be optimal in the limiting cases when there is at most one buyer per period, when capacity is not constraining, and asymptotically when the number of buyers and the capacity increases. The optimal auction significantly outperforms both suboptimal mechanisms when there are a moderate number of periods, capacity is constrained, and. the total volume of sales is not too large. The benefit also increases when variability in the dispersion in buyers' valuations or in the number of buyers per period increases.

Consistent with organization design theory, the performance effects of boundary spanners and team meetings were mediated by relational coordination, a communication- and relationship-intensive form of coordination. Contrary to organization. design theory, however, the performance effects of routines were also mediated :by relational coordination. Rather than serving as a replacement for interactions, as anticipated by organization design theory, routines work by enhancing interactions among participants. Likewise, all three coordinating mechanisms, including routines, were found to be increasingly effective under conditions of uncertainty.

J	Ang, S; Slaughter, S; Ng, KY				Ang, S; Slaughter, S; Ng, KY			Human capital and institutional determinants of information technology compensation: Modeling multilevel and cross-level interactions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						compensation; hierarchical linear modeling; management of IT professionals	HIERARCHICAL LINEAR-MODELS; MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION; NONPROFIT HOSPITALS; EMPLOYER SIZE; FOR-PROFIT; WAGE; INDUSTRY; ESTABLISHMENT; ORGANIZATION; SECTORS	Compensation is critical in attracting and retaining information technology (IT) professionals. However, there has been very little research on IT compensation. Juxtaposing theories of compensation that focus on human capital endowments and labor market segmentation, we hypothesize multilevel and cross-level determinants of compensation. We use hierarchical linear modeling to analyze archival salary data for 1,576 IT professionals across 39 institutions. Results indicate that compensation is directly determined by human capital endowments of education and experience. Institutional differentials do not directly drive compensation, but instead moderate the relationship of human capital endowments to compensation. Large institutions pay more than small institutions to IT professionals with more education, while small institutions pay more than large institutions to IT professionals with less education. Not-for-profit institutions pay more than for-profits to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education. Further, information-intensive institutions pay more than noninformation-intensive institutions to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education. We interpret these results in the context of institutional rigidity, core competencies, and labor shortages in the IT labor market.

J	Chan, LMA; Muriel, A; Shen, ZJM; Simchi-Levi, D; Teo, CP				Chan, LMA; Muriel, A; Shen, ZJM; Simchi-Levi, D; Teo, CP			Effective zero-inventory-ordering policies for the single-warehouse multiretailer problem with piecewise linear cost structures	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						approximation algorithms; zero-inventory-ordering policies; inventory; transportation; Truckload (TL); Less than Truckload (LTL)		We analyze the problem faced by companies that rely on TL (Truckload) and LTL (Less than Truckload) carriers for the distribution of products across their supply chain. Our goal is to design simple inventory policies and transportation strategies to satisfy time-varying demands over a finite horizon, while minimizing systemwide cost by taking advantage of quantity discounts in the transportation cost structures. For this purpose, we study the cost effectiveness of restricting the inventory policies to the class of zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) policies in a single-warehouse multiretailer scenario in which the warehouse serves as a cross-dock facility. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a ZIO inventory policy whose total inventory and transportation cost is no more than 4/3 (5.6/4.6 if transportation costs are stationary) times the optimal cost. However, finding the best ZIO policy is an NP-hard problem as well. Thus, we propose two algorithms to find an effective ZIO policy: An exact algorithm whose running time is polynomial for any fixed number of retailers, and a linear-programming-based heuristic whose effectiveness is demonstrated in a series of computational experiments. Finally, we extend the worst-case results developed in this paper to systems in which the warehouse does hold inventory.

Using data from 224 small- and medium-sized Danish firms, misfits are categorized, and; identified: Then, performance hypotheses, are developed. and tested using. regression models. We confirm the hypotheses that firms with situational misfits or contingency misfits, or both,, incur performance losses in return on assets compared with firms with no misfits. Contrary to our hypotheses;; we did not find that additional misfits lead to increased performance loss. Our results suggest that just one misfit of any kind may significantly compromise performance. These results yield a deeper understanding of organizational contingency theory, as well as implications for the rule-based fit-misfit organizational design model.

J	de Vericourt, F; Karaesmen, F; Dallery, Y				de Vericourt, F; Karaesmen, F; Dallery, Y			Optimal stock allocation for a capacitated supply system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; stock allocation; stochastic; multi-class; queues; make-to-stock system	DEMAND CLASSES; LOST SALES; INVENTORY; QUEUE; POLICIES; PRODUCT; COSTS	We consider a capacitated supply system that produces a single item that is demanded by several classes of customers. Each customer class may have a different backorder cost, so stock allocation arises as a key decision problem. We model the supply system as a multicustomer make-to-stock queue. Using dynamic programming, we show that the optimal allocation policy has a simple and intuitive structure. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm to compute the parameters of this optimal allocation policy. Finally, for. a typical supply chain design problem, we illustrate that ignoring the stock allocation dimension-a frequently encountered simplifying assumption-can lead to incorrect managerial decisions.

J	Kim, K; Chhajed, D				Kim, K; Chhajed, D			Product design with multiple quality-type attributes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; multiattribute; quality-type attribute; continuous optimization	LINE DESIGN; HEURISTICS; CONJOINT	We consider a product line design problem with multiple attributes for a monopolist serving a market with two customer segments. Products are designed with quality-type attributes for which more is always better than less. By considering multiple attributes, we derive a measure of multidimensional customer preference and offer insights into the optimal product design. When customers' preferences exhibit different orders in different attributes, our results show that products are differentiated horizontally where no one product is better than the other with respect to all attributes, and that there exists a region where the first-best solution for the monopolist is feasible despite the problem of cannibalization. Furthermore, single-product offering strategies are never optimal, so pooling of customer segments or reduction of the number of segments served will not occur.

J	Loch, CH; Kavadias, S				Loch, CH; Kavadias, S			Dynamic portfolio selection of NPD programs using marginal returns	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; resource allocation; portfolio election; portfolio investment; dynamic programming; marginal benefits	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PROJECT SELECTION; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; BANDITS; INDEX; TIME	Selecting. program portfolios within a budget constraint is, an important challenge in the management of, new product development (NPD). Optimal portfolios are difficult to define because of the combinatorial. complexity of project combinations. However, at the aggregate level of the strategic allocation of resources across product lines, investment in, a program is not an all-or-nothing decision, but can be adjusted,. resulting in a higher or lower program benefit (e.g., higher or lower quality). In some cases, resources can be adjusted even for individual projects. With this insight, one can use marginal analysis to optimally allocate the scarce budget. This article develops a dynamic model of resource allocation, taking into account multiple interacting factors, such as independent or correlated, uncertain market payoffs that change over, time, increasing or decreasing returns from the NPD investment, carry-over of the investment benefit over multiple periods, and interactions across market segments.. We characterize optimal policies in closed form and derive qualitative decision rules for managers.

J	Chintagunta, PK; Bonfrer, A; Song, I				Chintagunta, PK; Bonfrer, A; Song, I			Investigating them effects of store-brand introduction on retailer demand and pricing behavior	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						retailer pricing; store brands; manufacturer-retailer interactions	LOGIT-MODELS; CHANNEL; PERFORMANCE; PROMOTIONS; POWER; WARS	Researchers have recently been interested in studying the drivers of store-brand success as well as factors that motivate retailers to introduce store brands. In this paper, we study the effects of the introduction of a store-brand into a particular product category. Specifically, we are interested in the effect of store-brand introduction on the demand as well as on the supply side. On the demand side, we investigate the changes in preferences for the national brands and price elasticities in the category. On the supply side, we study the effects of the new entrant on the interactions between the national brand manufacturers and the retailer introducing the store brand, including how these interactions influence the retailer's pricing behavior. In doing so, we are also able to test whether the observed data are consistent with some of the commonly used assumptions regarding retailer pricing behavior. For the demand specification we use a random coefficients logit model that allows for consumer heterogeneity. The model parameters are estimated using aggregate data while explicitly accounting for endogeneity in retail prices. Our empirical results obtained from the oats product category based on store-level data from a multistore retail chain indicate that the store-brand introduction generates notable changes within the category The store-brand introduction coincides with an increase in the retailer's margins for the national brand. We find that the preferences for the national brand are relatively unaffected, by the introduction of the store-brand. While consumers are, in general, more price sensitive (in terms of elasticities) than they were prior to store-brand introduction, a statistical test of the differences in mean price elasticities across stores and between the two regimes fails to reject the hypothesis of no change in these elasticities. Elasticities in specific stores however, do increase after the store brand is introduced. We also find that there is considerable heterogeneity in the preferences for the store-brand. On the supply side, we test several forms of manufacturer-retailer interactions to identify retailer pricing behavior most consistent with the data. Our results indicate that the data reject several, commonly imposed, forms of interactions. In examining the nature of manufacturer interactions with the retailer, we find-that the manufacturer of the national brand appears to take a softer stance in its interactions with the retailer subsequent to store-brand entry. This finding is consistent with academic research and with articles in the popular press which suggest that the store brand enhances the retailer's bargaining ability vis-A-vis the manufacturers of the national brands. We also provide results from a second product category (frozen pasta) that are largely consistent with those found in the oats category.

We show that the structure of the internal and external environment in which a firm operates suggests when to innovate to the technology frontier. The criterion is maximization of the expected present value of profits during the life cycle. Computational studies complement the theoretical results and lead to insights about when to bundle innovations across features. The formalization was influenced by extensive interviews with managers in a high-technology firm that dominates its industry.

J	Mezias, SJ; Chen, YR; Murphy, PR				Mezias, SJ; Chen, YR; Murphy, PR			Aspiration-level adaptation in an American financial services organization: A field study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizations; decision making; goal setting	DECISION-MAKING; RISK-TAKING; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; FAILURE; RETURN; MODEL	Using field data from an American financial services organization, we examined the effects of three important variables in Cyert and March's (1963) initial conceptualization. of the aspiration-level adaptation process: The previous aspiration level, performance feedback, and social comparison. Past findings obtained in controlled contexts (Glynn et al. 1991; Lant 1992) have provided empirical support for the attainment discrepancy model (Lewin et al. 1944), which includes variables of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy (i.e., performance feedback). We replicated these findings in the field: The effects of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy on the current aspiration levels were significant and positive. In addition, we investigated the effect of social comparison using a variable based on the difference between the performance of the focal unit and the performance of comparable others (Greve 1998). Based on the assumption that decision makers. in organizations will expect to observe similar performance levels among those in the same comparison group (Wood 1989), we posited that the effect of social comparison would be negative, reflecting managerial efforts to reduce performance discrepancies among similar units. The empirical results supported the prediction from this reasoning.

We conduct a field study with an industrial supplier and examine the drivers of performance of the procurement process. Our research quantifies both the operational and strategic impacts of electronic integration in a B2B procurement environment for a supplier. Additionally, we show that the customer also obtains substantial benefits from efficient procurement transaction processing. We isolate the performance impact of technology choice and ordering processes on both the trading partners. A significant finding is that the supplier derives large strategic benefits when the customer initiates the system-and the supplier enhances the system's capabilities. With respect to operational benefits, we find that when suppliers have advanced electronic linkages, the order-processing system significantly increases benefits to both parties.

J	Cachon, GP; Harker, PT				Cachon, GP; Harker, PT			Competition and outsourcing with scale economies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						service operations; Nash equilibrium; coproduction; economies of scale; ECQ; queuing	DELIVERY-TIME COMPETITION; SERVICE FACILITY; ENVIRONMENT; CONGESTION; STABILITY; QUALITY; PRICE; COSTS	Scale economies are commonplace in operations, yet because of analytical challenges, relatively little is, known about how firms should compete in their presence. This paper presents a model of competition between two firms that face scale economies; (i.e., each firm's cost per unit of demand is decreasing in demand). A general framework is used, which incorporates competition between two service providers with price- and time-sensitive demand (a queuing game), And competition between two retailers with fixed-ordering costs and price-sensitive consumers (an Economic Order Quantity game). Reasonably general conditions are provided under which there exists at most one equilibrium, with both firms participating in the market. We demonstrate, in the context of the queuing game, that the lower cost firm in equilibrium may have a higher market share and a higher price, an enviable situation. We also allow each firm to outsource their production process to a supplier. Even if the supplier's technology is no better, than the firms' technology and,the supplier is required to establish dedicated capacity (so the suppliers; scale can be no greater than either firm's scale), we show that the firms strictly prefer to outsource. We conclude that scale economies provide a strong motivation for outsourcing that has not previously been identified in the literature.

J	Levy, M; Levy, H				Levy, M; Levy, H			Prospect theory: Much ado about nothing?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						prospect theory; prospect stochastic dominance; Markowitz stochastic dominance	STOCHASTIC-DOMINANCE; RISK-AVERSION; UTILITY; CHOICE	Prospet theory is a paradigm challenging the expected utility paradigm. One of the fundamental components of prospect theory is the S-shaped value function. The value function is mainly justified by experimental investigation of the certainty equivalents of prospects confined either to the negative or to the positive domain, but not of mixed prospects, which characterize most actual investments. We conduct an experimental study with mixed prospects, using, for the first time, recently developed investment criteria called Prospect Stochastic Dominance (PSD) and Markowitz Stochastic Dominance (MSD). We reject the S-shaped value function, showing that at least 62%-76% of the subjects cannot be characterized by such preferences. We find support for the Markowitz utility function, which is a reversed S-shaped function-exactly the opposite of the prospect theory value function. It is possible that the previous results supporting the S-shaped value function are distorted because the prospects had only positive or only negative outcomes, presenting hypothetical situations which individuals do not usually face, and which are certainly not common in financial markets.

J	Jedidi, K; Zhang, ZJ				Jedidi, K; Zhang, ZJ			Augmenting conjoint analysis to estimate consumer reservation price	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						reservation price; conjoint analysis; pricing strategy; product stratgy	DEMAND; MODEL	Consumer reservation price is a key concept in marketing and economics. Theoretically, this concept has been instrumental in studying consumer purchase decisions, competitive pricing strategies, and welfare economics. Managerially, knowledge of consumer reservation prices is critical for implementing many pricing tactics such as bundling, target promotions, nonlinear pricing, and one-to-one pricing, and for assessing the impact of marketing strategy on demand. Despite the practical and theoretical importance of this concept, its measurement at the individual level in a practical setting proves elusive. We propose a conjoint-based approach to estimate consumer-level reservation prices. This approach integrates the preference estimation of traditional conjoint with the economic theory of consumer choice. This integration augments the capability of traditional conjoint such that consumers' reservation prices for a product can be derived directly from the individual-level estimates of conjoint coefficients. With this augmentation, we can model a consumer's decision of not only which product to buy, but also whether to buy at all in a category. Thus, we can simulate simultaneously three effects that a change in price or the introduction of a new product may generate in a market: the customer switching effect, the cannibalization effect, and the market expansion effect. We show in a pilot application how this approach can aid product and pricing decisions.

J	Gatignon, H; Tushman, ML; Smith, W; Anderson, P				Gatignon, H; Tushman, ML; Smith, W; Anderson, P			A structural approach to assessing innovation: Construct development of innovation locus, type, and characteristics	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technological innovation; competence enhancing; competence destroying; competence acquisition	TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES; CREATIVE DESTRUCTION; COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS; DOMINANT DESIGNS; INDUSTRY; PRODUCT; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; MODULARITY; ADVANTAGE	We take a structural approach to assessing innovation. We develop a comprehensive set of measures to assess an innovation's locus, type, and characteristics. We find that the concepts of competence destroying and competence enhancing are composed of two distinct constructs that, although correlated, separately characterize an innovation: new competence acquisition and competence enhancement/destruction. We develop scales to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types. We show that innovations can be evaluated distinctively on these various dimensions with generally small correlations between them. We estimate the impact these different innovation characteristics and types have on time to introduction and perceived commercial success. Our results indicate the importance of taking a structural approach to describing innovations and to the differential importance of innovation locus, type, and characteristics on innovation outcomes. Our results also raise intriguing questions regarding the locus of competence acquisition (internal vs. external) and both innovation outcomes.

J	Jain, S; Kannan, PK				Jain, S; Kannan, PK			Pricing of information products on online servers: Issues, models, and analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; digital products; e-service; game theory	SERVICE FACILITY; INTERNET; GOODS	Online information servers that provide access to diverse databases where users can search for, browse through, and download the information they need have been rapidly increasing in number in the past few years. Online vendors have traditionally charged users for information on the based on the length of the time they were connected to the databases. With hardware and software advances, many online servers have recently started changing their pricing strategies to search-based and/or subscription-fee pricing. This paper examines the various issues involved in pricing these information products, and presents an economic approach to analyze conditions under which the various pricing schemes may prove optimal for the online servers. Our results show that the variation in consumer expertise and valuation of information affects the choice of a pricing strategy by the server. We present general conditions under which subscription-fee pricing is optimal even when consumer demand is inelastic. We also find that, given the cost structures characterizing the market, undifferentiated online servers can compete and coexist in the market each making positive profits. We show that in a competitive setting an increase in costs of online servers can sometimes benefit them by enabling them to differentiate themselves. Our results offer insights into the trends in pricing strategies and may provide an explanation as to why many servers may persist with connect-time strategies.

J	Shaffer, G; Zhang, ZJ				Shaffer, G; Zhang, ZJ			Competitive one-to-one promotions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						database marketing; game theory; strategy; price discrimination	PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; SWITCH	One-to-one promotions are possible when consumers are individually addressable and firms know something about each customer's preferences. We explore the competitive effects of one-to-one promotions in a model with two competing firms where the firms differ in size and consumers have heterogeneous brand loyalty. We find that one-to-one promotions always lead to an increase in price competition (average prices in the market decrease). However, we also find that one-to-one promotions affect market shares. This market-share effect may outweigh the effect of lower prices, benefiting the firm whose market share increases. Our results suggest that of two firms, the firm with the higher-quality product may gain from one-to-one promotions. Our model also has implications for the phenomenon of customer churn, where consumers switch to a less preferred brand due to targeted promotional incentives. We show that churning can arise optimally from firms pursuing a profit-maximizing strategy. Instead of trying to minimize it, the optimal way to manage customer churn is to engage in both offensive and defensive promotions with the relative mix depending on the marginal cost of targeting.

Inventory policies which maximise survival probabilities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Markov decision processes; inventory; start-up firms		New start-up companies, which are considered to be a vital ingredient in a successful economy, have a different objective than established companies: They want to maximise their chance of long-term survival. We examine the implications for their operating decisions of this different criterion by considering an abstraction of the inventory problem faced by a start-up manufacturing company. The problem is modelled under two criteria as a Markov decision process; the characteristics of the optimal policies under the two criteria are compared. It is shown that although the start-up company should be more conservative in its component purchasing strategy than if it were a well-established company, it should not be too conservative. Nor is its strategy monotone in the amount of capital it has available. The models are extended to allow for interest on investment and inflation.

J	Bohlmann, JD; Golder, PN; Mitra, D				Bohlmann, JD; Golder, PN; Mitra, D			Deconstructing the pioneer's advantage: Examining vintage effects and consumer valuations of quality and variety	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pioneering; order of entry	MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION; PRICE-COMPETITION; SEQUENTIAL ENTRY; GOODS INDUSTRIES; LEARNING-CURVE; FIRMS; INFORMATION; EQUILIBRIUM; INNOVATION	Several studies have demonstrated an order-of-entry effect on market share, suggesting that pioneers outperform later entrants. However, other research has pointed out the limitations of these studies and found evidence that many pioneers fail or have low market share. Given this background, the purpose of this research is to understand the conditions under which pioneers are more likely and also less likely to have an advantage. We propose a game-theoretic model that includes important sources of pioneer advantages as well as disadvantages. Specifically, we incorporate a pioneer advantage due to preemption in markets with heterogeneous tastes. In addition, we incorporate a potential pioneer disadvantage due to technology vintage effects, where later entrants utilizing improved technology can have lower costs and higher quality. The model allows us to evaluate the extent of vintage effects necessary to overcome a pioneer's advantage. Key relationships are found between the magnitude of the pioneer advantage or disadvantage and consumer valuations of product attributes (e.g., variety and quality). We empirically validate the model with vintage effect data in 36 product categories, and measures of consumer valuations of product variety and quality for 12 of these 36 categories. The results show that pioneers do better in product categories where variety is more important and worse in categories where product quality is more important. Pioneers in categories with high vintage effects are shown to have lower market shares and higher failure rates. Similar results appear when analyzing persistence of market leadership over time, further validating our model's major implications. We also present two case studies that illustrate key elements of the model.

J	Li, LD				Li, LD			Information sharing in a supply chain with horizontal competition	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							VERTICAL RESTRAINTS; DEMAND INFORMATION; COURNOT; OLIGOPOLY; BERTRAND; DUOPOLY	This paper examines the incentives for firms to share information vertically in a two-level supply chain in which there are an upstream firm (a manufacturer) and many downstream firms (retailers). The retailers are engaged in a Cournot competition and are endowed with some private information. Vertical information sharing has two effects: "direct effect" due to the changes in strategy by the parties involved in sharing the information and "indirect effect" (or "leakage effect") due to the changes in strategy by other competing firms (who may infer the information from the actions of the informed parties). Both changes would affect the profitability of the firms. We show that the leakage effect discourages the retailers from sharing their demand information with the manufacturer while encouraging them to share their cost information. On the other hand, the direct effect always discourages the retailers from sharing their information. When voluntary information sharing is not possible, we identify conditions under which information can be traded and show how price should be determined to facilitate such information exchange. We also examine the impact of vertical information sharing on the total supply chain profits and social benefits.

J	Thonemann, UW; Brown, AO; Hausman, WH				Thonemann, UW; Brown, AO; Hausman, WH			Easy quantification of improved spare parts inventory policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory policy; system approach; item approach; approximation	SYSTEMS; ITEM	This paper presents approximate analytical models to quantify the expected improvement in inventory investment when using a system approach to control inventory as opposed to a simpler item approach. A system approach ensures that a demand-weighted average fill rate is achieved at low inventory investment by assigning low fill rates to parts with high costs and high fill rates to parts with low costs. An item approach does not vary fill rates by parts but assigns identical fill rates to all parts. Using single-parameter functional representations of the skewness of unit costs and average demand across all parts in the system, simple approximate analytical expressions for the required inventory investment are derived for both approaches. The accuracy of the approximations is validated using data from a distribution center for computer spare parts. For these data, the solutions obtained by the approximations are very close to the exact values. The results show that inventory investments can be well approximated as a function of only a few cost and demand parameters. These expressions can be used to determine the percentage reduction in inventory investment for a particular target demand-weighted average fill rate when the superior system approach is used instead of the item approach. For increased ease of use, the percentage reduction in inventory when using a system as opposed to an item approach is computed over a range of realistic values for the key parameters of the model and a quadratic expression is fitted to the data. This fitted expression provides rough guidelines for the anticipated improvement with very limited data needed, prior to detailed modeling or implementation.

J	Anderson, ET				Anderson, ET			Sharing the wealth: When should firms treat customers as partners?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						partnering; customer relationship management; efficiency; contracting; pareto-efficiency; coase theorem	INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; BARGAINING MODEL; EFFICIENCY; PROFITS	Marketers often stress the importance of treating customers as partners. A fundamental premise of this perspective is that all parties can be weakly better off if they work together to increase joint surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. For marketing managers, this implies organizing marketing activities in a manner that maximizes total surplus. This logic is theoretically sound when agreements between partners are limitless and costless. In most consumer marketing contexts (business-to-consumer), this is typically not true. The question I ask is should one still expect firms to partner with consumers and reach Pareto-efficient agreements? In this paper, I use the example of a firm's choice of product configuration to demonstrate two effects. First, I show that a firm may configure a product in a manner that reduces total surplus but increases firm profits. Second, one might conjecture that increased competition would eliminate this effect, but I show that in a duopoly firm profits may be increasing in the cost of product completion. This second result suggests that firms may prefer to remain inefficient and/or stifle innovations. Both results violate a fundamental premise of partnering-that firms and consumers should work together to increase total surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. The model illustrates that Pareto-efficient agreements are less likely to occur if negotiation with individual partners is infeasible or costly, such as in business-to-consumer contexts. Consumer marketers in one-to-many marketing environments should be wary of treating customers as partners because Pareto-efficient agreements may not be optimal for their firm.

J	Amaldoss, W; Jain, S				Amaldoss, W; Jain, S			David vs. Goliath: An analysis of asymmetric mixed-strategy games and experimental evidence	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						competitive strategy; R&D; marketing; decision analysis; learning; experimental economics	STRICTLY COMPETITIVE GAMES; MINIMAX HYPOTHESIS; MARKETS; PRICE; PREEMPTION; TECHNOLOGY; PROMOTIONS	Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects. We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.

J	Taylor, TA				Taylor, TA			Supply chain coordination under channel rebates with sales effort effects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						channel coordination; supply chain management; incentives; rebates; sales effort	RETURNS POLICIES; HETEROGENEOUS SALESFORCES; INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; PRINCIPAL; GOODS	A channel rebate is a payment from a manufacturer to a retailer based on retailer sales to end consumers. Two common forms of channel rebates are linear rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold, and target rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed target rebate achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear rebate in a way that is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed target rebate and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome. Other contracts, such as linear rebate and returns or target rebate alone, cannot achieve coordination in a way that is implementable. Contrary to the view expressed in the literature that accepting returns weakens incentives for retailer sales effort, we find that the provision of returns strengthens incentives for effort.

J	Pich, MT; Loch, CH; De Meyer, A				Pich, MT; Loch, CH; De Meyer, A			On uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity in project management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						project management; uncertainty; complexity; instructionalism; project selection; ambiguity	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION; SUCCESS; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTS; FLEXIBILITY; PARALLEL; MODEL	This article develops a model of a project as a payoff function that depends on the state of the world and the choice of a sequence of actions. A causal mapping, which may be incompletely known by the project team, represents the impact of possible actions on the states of the world. An underlying probability space represents available information about the state of the world. Interactions among actions and states of the world determine the complexity of the payoff function. Activities are endogenous, in that they are the result of a policy that maximizes the expected project payoff. A key concept is the adequacy of the available information about states of the world and action effects. We express uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity in terms of information adequacy. We identify three fundamental project management strategies: instructionism, learning, and selectionism. We show that classic project management methods emphasize adequate information and instructionism, and demonstrate how modern methods fit into the three fundamental strategies. The appropriate strategy is contingent on the type of uncertainty present and the complexity of the project payoff function. Our model establishes a rigorous language that allows the project manager to judge the adequacy of the available project information at the outset, choose an appropriate combination of strategies, and set a supporting project infrastructure-that is, systems for planning, coordination and incentives, and monitoring.

J	Agarwal, R; Bayus, BL				Agarwal, R; Bayus, BL			The market evolution and sales takeoff of product innovations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; firm entry; entrepreneurship	LIFE-CYCLE; DIFFUSION-MODELS; INDUSTRY; ENTRY; DETERMINANTS; SURVIVAL; VIEW; TIME; EXIT	In contrast to the prevailing supply-side explanation that price decreases are the key driver of a sales takeoff, we argue that outward shifting supply and demand curves lead to market takeoff. Our fundamental idea is that sales in new markets are initially low because the first commercialized forms of new innovations are primitive. Then, as new firms enter, actual and perceived product quality improves (and prices possibly drop), which leads to a takeoff in sales. To provide empirical evidence for this explanation, we explore the relationship between takeoff times, price decreases, and firm entry for a sample of consumer and industrial product innovations commercialized in the United States over the past 150 years. Based on a proportional hazards analysis of takeoff times, we find that new firm entry dominates other factors in explaining observed sales takeoff times. We interpret these results as supporting the idea that demand shifts during the early evolution of a new market due to nonprice factors is the key driver of a sales takeoff.

The "lead user process" takes a different approach. It collects information about both needs and solutions from users at the leading edges of the target market, as well as from users in other markets that face similar problems in a more extreme form. This paper reports on a natural experiment conducted within the 3M Company on the effect of the lead user (LU) idea-gene ration process relative to more traditional methods. 3M is known for its innovation capabilities-and we find that the LU process appears to improve upon those capabilities. Annual sales of LU product ideas generated by the average LU project at 3M are conservatively projected to be $146 million after five years-more than eight times higher than forecast sales for the average contemporaneously conducted "traditional" project. Each funded LU project is projected to create a new major product line for a 3M division. As a direct result, divisions funding LU project ideas are projecting their highest rate of major product line generation in the past 50 years.

The model provides the ability to control the number of members that interact with each individual on the team. Through the use of analysis and computer simulations, it is shown how the amount of interaction affects the tradeoff between the expected performance and the number of replacements and interviews needed to find a good team using various replacement policies. New managerial insights into this process-such as the fact that it is not necessarily optimal to replace the worst-performing team member-are provided.

J	Leshno, M; Levy, H				Leshno, M; Levy, H			Preferred by "all" and preferred by "most" decision makers: Almost stochastic dominance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic dominance; almost stochastic dominance; mean-variance; risk aversion	UTILITY; RISK	While "most" decision makers may prefer one uncertain prospect over another, stochastic dominance rules as well as other investment criteria, will not reveal this preference due to some extreme utility functions in the case of even a very small violation of these rules. Such strict rules relate to "all" utility functions in a given class including extreme ones which presumably rarely represents investors' preference. In this paper we establish almost stochastic dominance (ASD) rules which formally reveal a preference for "most" decision makers, but not for "all" of them. The ASD rules reveal that choices which probably conform with "most" decision makers also solve some debates, e.g., showing, as practitioners claim, an ASD preference for a higher proportion of stocks in the portfolio as the investment horizon increases, a conclusion which is not implied by the well-known stochastic dominance rules.

J	Kou, SG				Kou, SG			A jump-diffusion model for option pricing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						contingent claims; high peak; heavy tails; interest rate models; rational expectations; overreaction and underreaction	RETURNS; PRICES; DISTRIBUTIONS; VARIANCE; BOND	Brownian motion and normal distribution have been widely used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing framework to model the return of assets. However, two puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations: the leptokurtic feature that the return distribution of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails than those of the normal distribution, and an empirical phenomenon called "volatility smile" in option markets. To incorporate both of them and to strike a balance between reality and tractability, this paper proposes, for the purpose of option pricing, a double exponential jump-diffusion model. In particular, the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions for a variety of option-pricing problems, including call and put options, interest rate derivatives, and path-dependent options. Equilibrium analysis and a psychological interpretation of the model are also presented.

J	von Hippel, E; Katz, R				von Hippel, E; Katz, R			Shifting innovation to users via toolkits	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						user innovation; toolkits; mass customization; product development	STICKY INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; LOCUS	In the traditional new product development process, manufacturers first explore user needs and then develop responsive products. Developing an accurate understanding of a user need is not simple or fast or cheap, however. As a result, the traditional approach is coming under increasing strain as user needs change more rapidly, and as firms increasingly seek, to serve "markets of one." Toolkits for user's innovation is an emerging alternative approach in which manufacturers actually abandon the attempt to understand user needs in detail in favor of transferring, need-related aspects of product and service development to users. Experience in fields where. the toolkit approach has been pioneered show custom products being developed much more quickly and at a lower cost. In this paper we explore toolkits for user innovation and explain why and how they work.

J	McGahan, AM; Porter, ME				McGahan, AM; Porter, ME			What do we know about variance in accounting profitability?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						performance; sustainability; industry structure; corporate strategy	INDUSTRY MATTER; CORPORATE; MARKETS; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE; MANAGEMENT; MISUSE; RETURN; RATES	In this paper, we analyze the variance of accounting profitability among a broad cross-section of firms in the American economy from 1981 to 1994. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the importance of year, industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects on accounting profitability among operating businesses across sectors. The findings indicate that industry and corporate-parent effects are important and related to one another. As expected, business-specific effects, which arise from competitive positioning and other factors, have a large influence on performance. The analysis reconciles the results of previous studies by exploring differences in method and data. We also identify the broad contributions and limitations of the research, and suggest avenues for further study. New approaches are necessary to generate significant insights about the relationships between industry, corporate-parent, and business influences on firm profitability.

The main idea is that each manager is capable of detecting and coordinating interactions only within his limited area of expertise. Only the CEO can coordinate companywide interactions. The optimal design of the organization trades off the costs and benefits of various configurations of managers. Our results consist of classifying the characteristics of activities and managerial costs that lead to the matrix organization, the functional hierarchy, the divisional hierarchy, or a flat hierarchy. We also investigate the effect of changing the costs of various managers on the nature of the optimal organization, including the extent of centralization.

J	David, JS; Hwang, YC; Pei, BKW; Reneau, JH				David, JS; Hwang, YC; Pei, BKW; Reneau, JH			The performance effects of congruence between product competitive strategies and purchasing management design	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						contingency theory; supply chain; competitive strategies; benchmarking; firm performance	ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS; CONTINGENCY APPROACH; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; SUPPLY CHAIN; ENVIRONMENT; DETERMINANTS; FIT	The objective of this study is to examine a performance contingency effect between product competitive strategy and organization design using an archival approach. Specifically, this study examines a sample of 194 firms from 20 industries based on the data collected by Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies (CAPS) in its benchmarking surveys between 1989-1994 and links the benchmarking data to the COMPUSTAT (Standard & Poor's) financial data of these firms. The results of the study reveal a contingency relationship among product competitive strategies, purchasing design characteristics, and overall firm financial performance (return on assets). Specifically, the nature of this contingency relationship suggests that a firm's product competitive strategy must be enabled with a complementary design in purchasing management to promote firm performance. Given the growing practice of benchmarking at the functional level, this study also examines whether or not a firm achieving a congruency in product strategy and design will necessarily enjoy higher operational efficiency at the purchasing management level. The results show that this is true only under specific conditions. The implications of the preceding findings are discussed accordingly.

J	Arya, A; Glover, J; Routledge, BR				Arya, A; Glover, J; Routledge, BR			Project assignment rights and incentives for eliciting ideas	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						real options; incentive problems; decentralization; promotion		In this paper, we study an incentive problem that arises between a principal and two agents because they value a real option differently. The real option in our model is a timing option. The agents have limited capacity to undertake projects, and each agent's capacity can be filled now or later. Because the principal cares about capacity in the aggregate but each agent cares only about his own capacity, the agents assign a higher value to the option to wait. As a result, agents sometimes withhold ideas from the principal. We show that decentralization can be a solution to this problem. Delegating assignment rights to an agent reduces the option value of waiting for the other agent sufficiently that he is willing to reveal his ideas.

J	Siggelkow, N				Siggelkow, N			Misperceiving interactions among complements and substitutes: Organizational consequences	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						interactions; systems of activities; complementarities; misperceptions; substitutes; organizational design; supermodularity; fragility; complexity; division-based incentives	MONOTONE COMPARATIVE STATICS; LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS; STRATEGY; TECHNOLOGIES; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; FIRMS; FIT	Systems composed of activity choices that interact in nonsimple ways can allow firms to create and sustain a competitive advantage. However, in complex systems, decision makers may not always have a precise understanding of the exact strength of the interaction between activities. Likewise, incentive and accounting systems may lead decision makers to ignore or misperceive interactions. This paper studies formally the consequences of misperceiving interaction effects between activity choices. Our results suggest that misperceptions with respect to complements are more costly than with respect to substitutes. As a result, firms should optimally invest more to gather information about interactions among complementary activities-e.g., concerning network effects-than about interactions among substitute activities. Similarly, the use of division-based incentive schemes appears to be more advisable for divisions whose products are substitutes than for divisions that produce complements. It is further shown that system fragility is not necessarily positively correlated with the strength of the interaction between choices. While systems of complements become increasingly fragile as the strength of interaction increases, systems of substitutes can become increasingly stable.

J	Detemple, J; Tian, WD				Detemple, J; Tian, WD			The valuation of American options for a class of diffusion processes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						American options; valuation; optimal exercise; diffusion; stochastic interest rate; stochastic volatility; integral equation; capped options; bound and approximations	STOCHASTIC INTEREST-RATES; FORMULA	W e present an integral equation approach for the valuation of American-style derivatives when the underlying asset price follows a general diffusion process and the interest rate is stochastic. Our contribution is fourfold. First, we show that the exercise region is determined by a single exercise boundary under very general conditions on the interest rate and the dividend yield. Second, based on this result, We derive a recursive integral equation for the exercise boundary and provide a parametric representation of the American option price: Third, we apply the results to models with stochastic volatility or stochastk interest rate, and to American bond options in one-factor models: For the cases studied, explicit parametric valuation formulas are obtained. Finally, we extend esults on American capped options to general diffusion prices. Numerical schemes based on approximations of the optimal stopping time (such as approximations based on a lower bound, or on a combination of lower and upper bounds) are shown to be valid in this context.

Since IPD has become an important new standard for managing new product development, this paper's general aim is to evaluate the research that has been conducted on it. Our three specific objectives include first critiquing the IPD literature by identifying problems with empirical research and recommending solutions. There are concerns about the overall approach, conceptualizing and operationalizing IPD characteristics, and selecting performance objectives. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate relationships between specific IPD characteristics and project performance. We indicate where relationships do or do not exist and identify variables that may moderate these relationships. Third, we offer suggestions for extending IPD research into studies of (a) the hierarchy of teams working on a project, (b) one company managing a portfolio of projects over time, and (c) two or more firms collaborating in a strategic alliance.

J	Smith, K; Dickhaut, J; McCabe, K; Pardo, JV				Smith, K; Dickhaut, J; McCabe, K; Pardo, JV			Neuronal substrates for choice under ambiguity, risk, gains, and losses	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; UNCERTAINTY; PREFERENCES; ACTIVATIONS	Economic forces shape the behavior of individuals and institutions. Forces affecting individual behavior are attitudes about payoffs (gains and losses) and beliefs about outcomes (risk and ambiguity). Under risk, the likelihoods of alternative outcomes are fully known. Under ambiguity, these likelihoods are unknown. In our experiment, payoffs and outcomes were manipulated independently during a classical choice task as brain activity was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we show that attitudes about payoffs and beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes exhibit interaction effects both behaviorally and neurally. Participants are risk averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses; they are ambiguity-seeking in neither gains nor losses. Two neural substrates for choice surfaced in the interaction between attitudes and beliefs: a dorsomedial neocortical system and a ventromedial system. This finding reveals that the brain does not honor a prevalent assumption of economics-the independence of the evaluations of payoffs and outcomes. The demonstration of a relationship between brain activity and observed economic choice attests to the feasibility of a neuroeconomic decision science.

J	Lee, H; Whang, S				Lee, H; Whang, S			The impact of the secondary market on the supply chain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain; secondary market; exchanges; market equilibrium	EMERGENCY LATERAL TRANSSHIPMENTS; INVENTORY SYSTEMS; COMMONALITY; INFORMATION; MODEL	This paper investigates the impacts of a secondary market where resellers can buy and sell excess inventories. We develop a two-period model with a single manufacturer and many resellers. At the beginning of the first period resellers order and receive products from the manufacturer, but at the beginning of the second period, they can trade inventories among themselves in the secondary market. We endogenously derive the optimal decisions for the resellers, along with the equilibrium market price of the secondary market. The secondary market creates two interdependent effects-a quantity effect (sales by the manufacturer) and an allocation effect (supply chain performance). The former is indeterminate; i.e., the total sales volume for the manufacturer may increase or decrease, depending on the critical fractile, The latter is always positive; i.e., the secondary market always improves allocative efficiency. The sum of the effects is also unclear-the welfare of the supply chain may or may not increase as a result of the secondary market. Lastly, we study potential strategies for the manufacturer to increase sales in the presence of the secondary market.

J	Hitt, LM; Frei, FX				Hitt, LM; Frei, FX			Do better customers utilize electronic distribution channels? The case of PC banking	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						online banking; financial services; electronic commerce; customer profitability	MARKETPLACES; MARKETS	Many service firms are pursuing electronic distribution strategies to augment existing physical infrastructure for product and service delivery. But little systematic study has been made for whether and how characteristics or behaviors might differ between customers who use electronic delivery systems and those who use traditional channels. We explore these differences by comparing customers who utilize personal-computer-based home banking (PC banking) to other bank customers. Case studies and detailed customer data from four institutions suggest that PC banking customers are apparently more profitable, principally due to unobservable characteristics extant before the adoption of PC banking. Demographic characteristics and changes in customer behavior following adoption of PC banking account for only a small fraction of overall differences. It also appears that retention is marginally higher for customers of the online channel.

J	Garfinkel, R; Gopal, R; Goes, P				Garfinkel, R; Gopal, R; Goes, P			Privacy protection of binary confidential data against deterministic, stochastic, and insider threat	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						confidentiality protection; database security; categorical data; inference disclosure	DATABASES	A practical model and an associated method are developed for providing consistent, deterministically correct responses to ad-hoc queries to a database containing a field of binary confidential data. COUNT queries, i.e., the number of selected subjects whose confidential datum is positive, are to be answered. Exact answers may allow users to determine an individual's confidential information. Instead, the proposed technique gives responses in the form of a number plus a guarantee so that the user can determine an interval that is sure to contain the exact answer. At the same time, the method is also able to provide both deterministic and stochastic protection of the confidential data to the subjects of the database. Insider threat is defined precisely and a simple option for defense against it is given. Computational results on a simulated database are very encouraging in that most queries are answered with tight intervals, and that the quality of the responses improves with the number of subjects identified by the query. Thus the results are very appropriate for the very large databases prevalent in business and governmental organizations. The technique is very efficient in terms of both time and storage requirements, and is readily scalable and implementable.

J	Pieters, R; Warlop, L; Wedel, M				Pieters, R; Warlop, L; Wedel, M			Breaking through the clutter: Benefits of advertisement originality and familiarity for brand attention and memory	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian models; attention and brand memory; advertising effectiveness; originality	VISUAL-ATTENTION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; INFORMATION; CREATIVITY; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; TIME; TEXT; AD; INCONGRUENCY	Rising levels of advertising competition have made it increasingly difficult to attract and hold consumers' attention and to establish strong memory traces for the advertised brand. A common communication strategy to break through this competitive clutter is to increase ad originality However, ad originality may have detrimental effects when consumers pay more attention to the ad at the expense of the advertised brand. Moreover, the positive effects of originality may quickly wane when the ad becomes familiar. Surprisingly, no research to date has examined such brand attention and memory effects of ad originality and familiarity The current study aims to fill this void. We use a stochastic model of the influence that ad originality and familiarity have on consumers' eye fixations to the key elements of advertisements-brand, text, and pictorial-and how the information extracted during eye fixations promotes memory for the advertised brand. The model explicitly accounts for heterogeneity due to consumers and advertisements. Infrared eye tracking was applied to collect eye fixation data from 119 consumers who paged through two general-audience magazines containing 58 full-page advertisements. Memory for the advertised brands was assessed with an indirect memory task. The model was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In support of our hypotheses, original advertisements drew more attention to the advertised brand. More importantly however, advertisements that were both original and familiar attracted the largest amount of attention to the advertised brand, which improved subsequent brand memory. In addition, original and familiar ads were found to promote brand memory directly. Implications of these findings for communication and media planning strategy are discussed.

J	Barker, VL; Mueller, GC				Barker, VL; Mueller, GC			CEO characteristics and firm R&D spending	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	60th Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Management	AUG   07, 2000	TORONTO, CANADA	Acad Management		chief executives; research and development; innovation	MANAGEMENT TEAM CHARACTERISTICS; TOP-MANAGEMENT; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; SELECTIVE PERCEPTION; DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; CORPORATE PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; EXECUTIVE SELECTION; MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS; INCENTIVES	Over the past fifteen years, a number of studies have examined the determinants of firm R&D spending. These studies, however, almost invariably focus on the role of firm or external ownership characteristics in predicting R&D spending while overlooking the attributes of the top managers involved in allocating corporate resources. In this study, we change that focus by empirically examining how R&D spending as compared to industry competitors varies at firms based on the characteristics of their CEOs. Using a sample of publicly traded firms, we find that CEO characteristics explain a significant proportion of the sample variance in firm R&D spending even when corporate strategy, ownership structure, and other firm-level attributes are controlled. In terms of individual CEO characteristics, we find that R&D spending is greater at firms where CEOs are younger, have greater wealth invested in firm stock and significant career experience in marketing and/or engineering/R&D. In contrast to existing theory we find that the amount of a CEO's formal education had no significant association with R&D spending once a CEO has attained a college degree. However, significant R&D spending increases are found at firms where CEOs have advanced science-related degrees. From subgroup analyses, we further find that CEO effects on relative R&D spending increase with longer CEO tenure implying that CEOs, over time, may mold R&D spending to suit their own preferences. From these results, we make implications for both research on determinants of R&D spending and managerial practice.

J	Bleichrodt, H; Schmidt, U				Bleichrodt, H; Schmidt, U			A context-dependent model of the gambling effect	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						nonexpected utility; gambling effect; risk aversion; intransitivity	HEALTHY-YEARS EQUIVALENTS; UTILITY-ASSESSMENT; REGRET THEORY; CHOICE; UNCERTAINTY; DECISION; PREFERENCES; VIOLATIONS; RISK	This paper presents a context-dependent theory of decision under risk. The relevant contextual factor is the presence of a riskless lottery in a preference comparison. The theory only deviates from expected utility if the set of options contains both riskless and risky lotteries, The main motivation for the theory is to explain the gambling effect. Contrary to previous theories of the gambling effect, the present theory is consistent with stochastic dominance. It can, however, violate transitivity. The theory allows for a decomposition of the interaction between risk aversion and gambling aversion and thereby extends the classical Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion.

J	Christ, D; Avi-Itzhak, B				Christ, D; Avi-Itzhak, B			Strategic equilibrium for a pair of competing servers with convex cost and balking	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						two-server queues; competing servers; Nash equilibrium; balking	ENVIRONMENT	A two-person game is formulated for a queuing situation involving a pair of exponential servers competing for arriving customers. The servers have identical characteristics except for their service rates. Each server is free to select its own service rate. The objective of each server is to select a service rate that will maximize its own profit. Arrivals are Poisson. The probability that an arriving customer enters the queue is allowed to depend on the queue length at the time of arrival. The proportion of arrivals to a given server is shown to be strictly concave in the server's own service rate and decreasing in the other service rate. Furthermore, we show that when the cost function is convex and increasing, there exists a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium point for the resulting game.

J	Zantek, PF; Wright, GP; Plante, RD				Zantek, PF; Wright, GP; Plante, RD			Process and product improvement in manufacturing systems with correlated stages	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality and process improvement; total quality management; investments in learning; multistage manufacturing systems	MODELS; ALLOCATION; TARGETS; DESIGN; INSPECTION; REDUCTION	Manufacturing systems typically contain processing and assembly stages whose output quality is significantly affected by the output quality of preceding stages in the system. This study offers and empirically validates a procedure for (1) measuring the effect of each stage's performance on the output quality of subsequent stages including the quality of the final product, and (2) identifying stages in a manufacturing system where management should concentrate investments in process quality improvement. Our proposed procedure builds on the precedence ordering of the stages in the system and uses the information provided by correlations between the product quality measurements across stages. The starting point of our procedure is a computer executable network representation of the statistical relationships between the product quality measurements; execution automatically converts the network to a simultaneous-equations model and estimates the model parameters by the method of least squares. The parameter estimates are used to measure and rank the impact of each stage's performance on variability in intermediate stage and final product quality. We extend our work by presenting an economic model, which uses these results, to guide management in deciding on the amount of investment in process quality improvement for each stage. We report some of the findings from an extensive empirical validation of our procedure using circuit board production line data from a major electronics manufacturer. The empirical evidence presented here highlights the importance of accounting for quality linkages across stages in (a) identifying the sources of variation in product quality and (b) allocating investments in process quality improvement.

J	Treharne, JT; Sox, CR				Treharne, JT; Sox, CR			Adaptive inventory control for nonstationary demand and partial information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory control; Markov-modulated demand; partially observed Markov decision process; myopic; limited look-ahead	MARKOV DECISION-PROCESSES; MYOPIC POLICIES; MODELS; MANAGEMENT; LIKELIHOOD; BOUNDS	This paper examines several different policies for an inventory control problem in which the demand process is nonstationary and partially observed. The probability distribution for the demand in each period is determined by the state of a Markov chain, the core process. However, the state of this core process is not directly observed, only the actual demand is observed by the decision maker. Given this demand process, the inventory control problem is a composite-state, partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), which is an appropriate model for a number of dynamic demand problems. In practice, managers often use certainty equivalent control (CEC) policies to solve such a problem. However, this paper presents results that demonstrate that there are other practical control policies that almost always provide much better solutions for this problem than the CEC policies commonly used in practice. The computational results also indicate how specific problem characteristics influence the performance of each of the alternative policies.

Pricing their American-style counterparts, which provide early exercise opportunities, poses the additional difficulty of solving a dynamic optimization problem to determine the optimal exercise strategy. A procedure for pricing American-style Asian options of the Bermudan flavor, based on dynamic programming combined with finite-element piecewise-polynomial approximation of the value function, is developed here. A convergence proof is provided. Numerical experiments illustrate the consistency and efficiency of the procedure. Theoretical properties of the value function and of the optimal exercise strategy are also established.

J	Gavirneni, S				Gavirneni, S			Information flows in capacitated supply chains with fixed ordering costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; information sharing; inventory control	LIMITED PRODUCTION CAPACITY; UNCERTAIN DEMANDS; INVENTORY MODEL; CRITERION; POLICIES	Many organizations have only recently recognized that sharing information with other members in their supply chain can lead to significant reduction in the total costs. Usually these information flows are incorporated into existing operating policies at the various parties. In this paper we argue that, in some cases, it may be necessary to change the way the supply chain is managed to make complete use of the information flows. We support this argument by analyzing a supply chain containing a capacitated supplier and a retailer facing i.i.d. demands. In addition there are fixed ordering costs between the retailer and the supplier. In this setting, we consider two models: (1) the retailer is using the optimal (s, S) policy and providing the supplier information about her inventory levels; and (2) the retailer, still sharing information on her inventory levels, orders in a period only if by the previous period the cumulative end-customer demand since she last ordered was greater than delta. Thus, in Model 1, information sharing is used to supplement existing policies; while, in Model 2, we have redefined operating policies to make better use of the information flows. We will show, via a detailed computational study, that the total supply chain costs of Model 2 are 10.4% lower, on the average, than that of Model 1. We noticed that this reduction in costs is higher at higher capacities, higher supplier penalty costs, lower retailer penalty costs, moderate values of set-up cost, and at lower end-customer demand variances.

J	Grosfeld-Nir, A; Gerchak, Y				Grosfeld-Nir, A; Gerchak, Y			Multistage production to order with rework capability	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multistage production systems; random yields; rigid demand; rework	RIGID DEMAND; RANDOM YIELDS; SINGLE; SYSTEMS	This study considers multistage production systems where defective units can be reworked repeatedly at every stage. Production, as well as rework, is in lots requiring set-up and variable production costs, and orders need to be filled in their entirety. The yield of each stage is uncertain, so several production runs may need to be attempted until the quantity of finished products is sufficient. The trade-off at each stage is between using small lots, possibly necessitating repeated rework set-ups and large lots, which may result in costly overproduction. Multistage manufacturing facilities with rework capabilities are quite common in practice, but their optimal operation when orders have to be met in full has been virtually unexplored. We, show that a multistage system where only one of the stages requires a setup (a "single-bottleneck system") can be reduced to a single-stage system. Moreover, if it is possible to arrange the operations in any order, we prove that it is best to make the "bottleneck" the first stage of the system. We also develop recursive algorithms for solving two- and three-stage systems, where all stages require set-ups, optimally, Generalizations to systems where rework yields and costs differ from those of initial processing are also discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to improve and extend their results. We will show that a tight lower bound can be calculated by solving another SDP. Also, we will show that these problems can be solved very quickly by a newly developed cutting plane algorithm when n is less than six or seven.

J	Benjaafar, S				Benjaafar, S			Modeling and analysis of congestion in the design of facility layouts	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						facility layout; queueing networks; quadratic assignment problem; material handling; performance evaluation	SINGLE	Reducing manufacturing lead times and minimizing work-in-process (WIP) inventories are the cornerstones of popular manufacturing strategies such as Lean, Quick Response, and Just-in-Time Manufacturing. In this paper, we present a model that captures the relationship between facility layout and congestion-related measures of performance. We use the model to introduce a formulation of the facility layout design problem where the objective is to minimize work-in-process (WIP). In contrast to some recent research, we show that layouts obtained using a WIP-based formulation can be very different from those obtained using the conventional quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation. For example, we show that a QAP-optimal layout can be WIP-infeasible. Similarly, we show that two QAP-optimal layouts can have vastly different WIP values. In general, we show that WIP is not monotonic in material-handling travel distances. This leads to a number of surprising results. For instance, we show that it is possible to reduce overall distances between departments but increase WIP. Furthermore, we find that the relative desirability of a layout can be affected by changes in material-handling capacity even when travel distances remain the same. We examine the effect of various system parameters on the difference in WIP between QAP- and WIP-optimal layouts. We find that although there are conditions under which the difference in WIP is significant, there are those under which both layouts are WIP-equivalent.

The implications of the infeasibility in super-efficiency IDEA models with respect to the efficiency ranking of the DMUs is explored. Based on the analysis, we show that it is still possible to obtain the full ranking of the entire observation set when infeasibilities arise in super-efficiency IDEA models.

We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.

For a large set of institutional trades we compare out-of-sample, characteristic-based estimates of price impact to actual price impacts. Predictive predetermined firm characteristics, chosen to proxy for the severity of adverse selection in the equity market, the non-information-based costs of making a market in the stock, and the extent of shareholder heterogeneity, include relative size, historical relative trading volume, institutional holdings, and the inverse of the stock price. We find numerous aspects of trade execution which are significantly related to the price impact forecast error in economically plausible ways: For example, the predicted price impact overestimates the actual price impact for very large trades, for trades executed in a more patient manner, and for trades where the institution pays higher commissions.

J	Kirsch, LJ; Sambamurthy, V; Ko, DG; Purvis, RL				Kirsch, LJ; Sambamurthy, V; Ko, DG; Purvis, RL			Controlling information systems development projects: The view from the client	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						control; IS project management; IS-client relationships	MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGY	Increasingly, business clients are actively leading information systems (IS) projects, often in collaboration with IS professionals, and they are exercising a greater degree of project control. Control is defined as all attempts to motivate individuals to achieve desired objectives, and it can be exercised via formal and informal modes. Much of the previous research investigating the choice of control mode has focused on direct reporting relationships between IS project leaders and their superiors in a hierarchical setting. However, the client-IS relationships may take on a variety of forms, including both hierarchical and lateral settings, Moreover, prior research has found that the knowledge of the systems development process is a key antecedent of control, yet clients are unlikely to be as knowledgeable as IS professionals about this process. It is therefore unclear whether prior findings will generalize to the client-IS pair, and the goal of this research is to examine the exercise of control across this relationship. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey of 69 pairs of clients and IS project leaders. The results are largely consistent with prior research on the antecedents of formal control modes, but they shed new insight on the choice of informal control modes.

J	Song, JS				Song, JS			Order-based backorders and their implications in multi-item inventory systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multi-Item systems; backorders; demand correlation; performance evaluation; approximation; assemble-to-order; component commonality; product structure	COMPONENT COMMONALITY; MODEL; STOCK	In a multi-item inventory system, such as an assemble-to-order manufacturing system or an online-retailing system, a customer order typically consists of several different items in different amounts. The average order-based backorders are the average number of customer orders that are not yet completely filled, While this is an important measure of customer satisfaction, it has not been widely studied in the operations management literature. This is largely because its evaluation involves the joint distribution of inventory levels of different items and other intricate relations, which is computationally dreadful. Taking a novel approach, this paper develops a tractable way of evaluating this measure exactly. We also develop easy-to-compute bounds, which require the evaluation of item-based backorders only. Numerical experiments indicate that the average of the lower and upper bounds is very effective. The exact results show surprisingly simple structures, which shed light on how system parameters affect the performance. Using these results, we study several examples to gain managerial insights. Questions addressed include: What are the implications of item-based inventory planning decisions on the order-based performance? What is the impact of introducing common components on inventory and service trade-offs? Would order-delivery performance be improved if we restrict the number of choices in product configurations?

It seems useful to have models that can help senior managers of bidder firms make informed decisions about the amount of premium, over the target's share prices prevailing prior to merger announcement, that can be justified on the basis of operational synergies. The goal of this article is to capture important parameters from the production side that have a bearing on the valuation of the target's shares. We show that the production characteristics of both the bidder and the target matter in a significant way. For example, if the bidder and target operate in independent markets, the bidder has flexible production facilities but the target's production facilities are inflexible, then an increase in the bidder's demand can make the target less attractive and lower the value of operational synergy.

J	Clemons, EK; Hann, IH; Hitt, LM				Clemons, EK; Hann, IH; Hitt, LM			Price dispersion and differentiation in online travel: An empirical investigation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						electronic markets; price dispersion; product differentiation	STATES AIRLINE INDUSTRY; ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES; POWER	Previous research has examined whether price dispersion exists in theoretically highly efficient Internet markets. However, much of the previous work has been focused on industries with low cost and undifferentiated products. In this paper, we examine the presence of price dispersion and product differentiation using data on the airline ticket offerings of online travel agents (OTAs). We find that different OTAs offer tickets with substantially different prices and characteristics when given the same customer request. Some of this variation appears to be due to product differentiation-different OTAs specialize by systematically offering different trade-offs between ticket price and ticket quality (minimizing the number of connections, matching requested departure and return time). However, even after accounting for differences in ticket quality ticket prices vary by as much as 18% across OTAs. In addition, OTAs return tickets that are strictly inferior to the ticket offered by another OTA for the same request between 2.2% and 28% of the time. Overall, this suggests the presence of both price dispersion and product differentiation in the online travel market.

J	Bertsimas, D; Demir, R				Bertsimas, D; Demir, R			An approximate dynamic programming approach to multidimensional knapsack problems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS; TABU SEARCH; ALGORITHMS; CONSTRAINTS	We present an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach for the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). We approximate the value function (a) using parametric and nonparametric methods and (b) using a base-heuristic. We propose a new heuristic which adaptively rounds the solution of the linear programming relaxation. Our computational study suggests: (a) the new heuristic produces high quality solutions fast and robustly, (b) state of the art commercial packages like CPLEX require significantly larger computational time to achieve the same quality of solutions, (c) the ADP approach using the new heuristic competes successfully with alternative heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms, (d) the ADP approach based on parametric and nonparametric approximations, while producing reasonable solutions, is not competitive. Overall, this research illustrates that the base-heuristic approach is a promising computational approach for MKPs worthy of further investigation.

J	Zohar, E; Mandelbaum, A; Shimkin, N				Zohar, E; Mandelbaum, A; Shimkin, N			Adaptive behavior of impatient customers in tele-queues: Theory and empirical support	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						exponential queues; abandonment; invisible queues; tele-queues; adaptive customer behavior; tele-services; call centers	INVISIBLE QUEUES; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM	We address the modeling and analysis of abandonments from a queue that is invisible to its occupants. Such queues arise in remote service systems, notably the Internet and telephone call centers; hence, we refer to them as tele-queues. A basic premise of this paper is that customers adapt their patience (modeled by an abandonment-time distribution) to their service expectations, in particular to their anticipated waiting time. We present empirical support for that hypothesis, and propose an M/M/m-based model that incorporates adaptive customer behavior. In our model, customer patience depends on the mean waiting time in the queue. We characterize the resulting system equilibrium (namely, the operating point in steady state), and establish its existence and uniqueness when changes in customer patience are bounded by the corresponding changes in their anticipated waiting time. The feasibility of multiple system equilibria is illustrated when this condition is violated. Finally, a dynamic learning model is proposed where customer expectations regarding their waiting time are formed through accumulated experience. We demonstrate, via simulation, convergence to the theoretically anticipated equilibrium, while addressing certain issues related to censored-sampling that arise because of abandonments.

J	Krishnan, V; Bhattacharya, S				Krishnan, V; Bhattacharya, S			Technology selection and commitment in new product development: The role of uncertainty and design flexibility	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; design flexibility; technology selection	DEFINITION	Selecting the right technologies to incorporate in new products is a particularly challenging aspect of new product definition and development. While newer advanced technologies may offer improved performance, they also make the product development process more risky and challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problem of technology selection and commitment under uncertainty, a major challenge to firms in turbulent environments. We argue that the ''pizza-bin'' approach of rejecting prospective technologies outright may not serve firms well when the pressure to differentiate products is enormous. After motivating the challenges and decisions facing firms using a real-life application from Dell Computer Corporation, we formulate a mathematical model of a firm that must define its products in the presence of technology uncertainty. Specifically, the firm faces two options: (i) a proven technology that is known to be viable and (ii) a prospective technology that offers superior price to performance results but whose viability is not a fully certain outcome. To minimize the impact of technology uncertainty, we consider two approaches to design flexibility termed parallel path and sufficient design, which allow the firm to concurrently develop its products while the technology is being validated. Our analysis helps understand appropriateness of the different flexible design approaches. We illustrate our model with the Dell portable computer example and note the managerial implications of our analysis.

J	Zenios, SA				Zenios, SA			Optimal control of a paired-kidney exchange program	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						kidney transplantation; organ exchange; patient autonomy; double-ended queues; Brownian approximations	CANDIDATES; DONORS; LIST	Organ exchanges are expected to increase the utilization of living donors and to alleviate the critical shortage of organs for transplantation. The typical arrangement involves a direct exchange between two blood-type incompatible donor-candidate pairs. An alternate possibility is an indirect exchange between one such pair and the highest priority candidate on the regular waiting list for cadaveric organs. This paper focuses on the mix of direct and indirect exchanges that maximizes the expected total discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of the candidates in the participating pairs. Direct exchanges are preferable because the candidate receives a living-donor organ instead of the inferior cadaveric organ an indirect exchange provides. However, the latter involves a shorter wait. To capture this tradeoff, we develop a double-ended queueing model for an exchange system with two types of donor-candidate pairs, and obtain an optimal dynamic exchange policy by invoking a Brownian approximation. The policy takes the form of a two-sided regulator in which new pairs will join the exchange system to wait for a direct exchange if and only if the process modeling the exchange system is within the regulator's two barriers. In all other circumstances, new pairs will participate in an indirect exchange. Expressions for the optimal barriers are obtained under a variety of assumptions about the objective function, including one of complete candidate autonomy. The analysis identifies three design principles that will amplify the likelihood of an exchange program's success. First, exchange programs must involve the coordinated activities of multiple local transplant centers to enjoy the substantial benefits of resource pooling. Second, participant wait must be controlled through indirect exchanges. Third, the program must respect participants' autonomy and weigh that autonomy against the broader goal of maximizing their overall welfare.

J	Ding, M; Eliashberg, J				Ding, M; Eliashberg, J			Structuring the new product development pipeline	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; new products; innovations pipelines; R&D projects; pharmaceutical industry	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INDUSTRY; RETURNS; MODELS; COSTS	dIn many new product development (NPD) situations, the development process is characterized by uncertainty, and no single development approach will necessarily lead to a successful product. To increase the likelihood of having at least one successful product, multiple approaches may be simultaneously funded at the various NPD stages. The managerial challenge is to construct ex ante an appropriate NPD pipeline by choosing the right number of approaches to be funded at each stage. This so-called pipeline problem is also present in, among others, advertising copy selection and new products test markets problems. We describe here a normative model for structuring pipelines for such situations. The optimal structure of the pipeline is driven by the cost of the development approach, its probability of survival, and the expected profitability. We illustrate the workability and implications of the model by applying it to some real-world scenarios in the pharmaceutical industry, and by comparing its normative pipeline recommendations against actual pipelines. Our results suggest that, for the cases we studied, firms tend to use narrower pipelines for their new drug development than they should, and thereby they underspend on research and development. We also present general qualitative insights for one- and two-stage NPD optimal pipeline structures.

Our premise is that economic explanations for venture finance, which do not consider how social ties influence this process, are undersocialized and incomplete. However, we also argue that organization theoretic arguments, which draw on the concept of social obligation, are oversocialized. Drawing on the organizational theory literature, and in-depth fieldwork with 50 high-technology ventures, we examine the effects of direct and indirect ties between entrepreneurs and 202 seed-stage investors on venture finance decisions. We show that these ties influence the selection of ventures to fund through a process of information transfer.

J	Nambisan, S				Nambisan, S			Complementary product integration by high-technology new ventures: The role of initial technology strategy	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new venture; high technology; complementary product; integration; software	TOOL INTEGRATION; FLEXIBILITY; MODULARITY; FRAMEWORK	In this paper, we investigate the relationship between complementary product integration and the initial technology strategy of a high-technology new venture. With customers placing considerable emphasis on cross-product integration, the success of a new venture is dependent as much on its ability to integrate its product with relevant complementary products as on the core product functionality itself. We identify three types of complementary product integration: value-added internal, add-on module, and data interface. We argue that the adoption of proactive initial technology strategy critically determines the ability of a high-technology new venture to rapidly and efficiently integrate its product with new and emerging complementary products. More specifically, we offer hypotheses that relate initial design and development strategies to the number and the type of complementary product integrations achieved by a new venture in the initial years. The hypotheses are tested using data from a set of U.S.-based software new ventures. The results support our arguments and imply the need for high-technology new ventures to adopt an explicit complementary product focus during initial product design.

J	Angelus, A; Porteus, EL				Angelus, A; Porteus, EL			Simultaneous capacity and production management of short-life-cycle, produce-to-stock goods under stochastic demand	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity management; production management; capacity expansion; capacity contraction; finite lifetime; stochastic demand; nonstationary	LIMITED PRODUCTION CAPACITY; INVENTORY MODEL; INVESTMENT STRATEGIES; UNCERTAIN DEMANDS; COST CRITERION; EXPANSION; RESOURCES	This paper derives the optimal simultaneous capacity and production plan for a short-life-cycle, produce-to-stock good under stochastic demand. Capacity can be reduced as well as added, at exogenously set unit prices. In both cases studied, with and without carry-over of unsold units, a target interval policy is optimal: There is a (usually different) target interval for each period such that capacity should be changed as little as possible to bring the level available into that interval. Our contribution in the case of no carry-over, is a detailed characterization of the target intervals, assuming demands increase stochastically at the beginning of the life cycle and decrease thereafter. In the case of carry-over, we establish the general result and show that capacity and inventory are economic substitutes: The target intervals decrease in the initial stock level and the optimal unconstrained base stock level decreases in the capacity level. In both cases, optimal service rates are not necessarily constant over time. A numerical example illustrates the results.

J	Moinzadeh, K				Moinzadeh, K			A multi-echelon inventory system with information exchange	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply-chain management; inventory management; information exchange	SUPPLY CHAIN; POLICIES; STRATEGY	In this paper, we consider a supply-chain model consisting of a single product, one supplier, and multiple retailers. Demand at the retailers is random, but stationary. Each retailer places her orders to the supplier according to the well-known (Q, R) policy. We assume that the supplier has online information about the demand, as well as inventory activities of the product at each retailer, and uses this information when making order/replenishment decisions. We first propose a replenishment policy for the supplier, which incorporates information about the inventory position of the retailers. Then, we provide an exact analysis of the operating measures of such systems. Assuming the inventory/replenishment decisions are made centrally for the system, we compare the performance of our model with those that do not use information in their decision making, namely, systems that use installation stock policies via a numerical experiment. Based on our numerical results, we identify the parameter settings under which information sharing is most beneficial.

J	Korkie, B; Turtle, HJ				Korkie, B; Turtle, HJ			A mean-variance analysis of self-financing portfolios	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						investment opportunity set; long/short portfolios; spanning; intersection	MULTIVARIATE TESTS; EFFICIENCY; RETURNS; ASSET; PERFORMANCE; CAPM	T his paper develops the analytics and geometry of the investment opportunity set (IOS) and the test statistics for self-financing portfolios. A self-financing portfolio is a set of long and short investments such that the sum of their investment weights, or net investment, is zero. This contrasts with a standard portfolio that has investment weights summing to one. Examples of self-financing portfolios are hedges, overlays, arbitrage portfolios, swaps, and long/short portfolios. A standard portfolio plus the IOS of self-financing portfolios form a restricted IOS hyperbola with restricted efficient set constants that differ from the usual constants. The restrictions affect statistical tests of portfolio efficiency, which are developed for the self-financing restrictions. As an application, we consider the self-financing portfolios formed by Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), based on market capitalization and value. In contrast to Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), we find that their restricted IOS is significantly different from the unrestricted IOS with the implication that the Fama-French tests are misspecified.

Instead, the required column information is generated at each iteration of the simplex algorithm. This paper shows that, even if the number of variables is low enough for explicit inclusion in the model with the available technology, it may still be more efficient to resort to column generation for some class of problems.

J	King, AA; Tucci, CL				King, AA; Tucci, CL			Incumbent entry into new market niches: The role of experience and managerial choice in the creation of dynamic capabilities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						disk drives; dynamic capabilities; niche innovation; market entry; organizational inertia; experience	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; SURVIVAL; INERTIA; US; DESTRUCTION; TRANSITIONS; CAPACITY	Increasingly, technological innovation creates markets for new products and services. To survive, firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively. In this paper, we explore these issues by investigating entry patterns in the disk-drive industry. We investigate the effect of experience in existing markets and experience with previous market entry. We find that experience in previous markets increased the probability that a firm would enter a new market. We show that this experience had greater value if the firm entered the new market. We infer that managers chose to enter these markets to obtain this increase in value.

J	Ho, TH; Savin, S; Terwiesch, C				Ho, TH; Savin, S; Terwiesch, C			Managing demand and sales dynamics in new product diffusion under supply constraint	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing-operation interface; bass diffusion model; new product forecasting; capacity planning	MODELS; EXPANSION	The Bass diffusion model is a well-known parametric approach to estimating new product demand trajectory over time. This paper generalizes the Bass model by allowing for a supply constraint. In the presence of a supply constraint, potential customers who are not able to obtain the new product join the waiting queue, generating backorders. and potentially reversing their adoption decision, resulting in lost sales. Consequently, they do not generate the positive "word-of-mouth" that is typically assumed in the Bass model, leading to significant changes in the new product diffusion dynamics. We study how a firm should manage its supply processes in a new product diffusion environment with backorders and lost sales. We consider a make-to-stock production environment and use optimal control theory to establish that it is never optimal to delay demand fulfillment. This result is interesting because immediate fulfillment may accelerate the diffusion process and thereby result in a greater loss of customers in the future. Using this result, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting demand and sales dynamics over the product life cycle. We then use these expressions to investigate how the firm should determine the size of its capacity and the time to market its new product. We show that delaying a product launch to build up an initial inventory may be optimal and can be used as a substitute for capacity. Also, the optimal time to market and capacity increase with the coefficients of innovation and imitation in the adoption population. We compare our optimal capacity and time to market policies with those resulting from exogeneous demand forecasts in order to quantify the value of endogenizing demand.

J	Kim, N; Han, JK; Srivastava, RK				Kim, N; Han, JK; Srivastava, RK			A dynamic IT adoption model for the SOHO market: PC generational decisions with technological expectations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technological expectations; information technology; network externalities; logit modeling	NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; INFORMATION; ORIENTATION; DIFFUSION; UNCERTAINTY; COMPETITION; SEARCH; RISK	The small-office/home-office (SOHO) professionals comprise the fastest growing segment in the labor force today. Typically being a one-person business based at home, SOHO owners mostly rely on office information technology to single handedly run their entire operation. Despite the segment's ostensibly growing dependence and influence on the information technology (IT) industry, still very little is known about the dynamics between SOHO and IT products. With the purpose of addressing this void, we investigate the SOHO professionals' adoption patterns of multigenerational IT products. Accordingly, we develop and empirically estimate an individual SOHO-level initial- and repeat-purchase logit model that captures the procurement patterns for successive generations of technological products, namely the PC category. Specifically, we find that SOHO professionals' procurement choices are influenced by a number of salient dimensions (i.e., income, performance, price, interpurchase time, network externalities). Furthermore, some SOHO owners are found to have a preference for a future (expected) generation (over a currently available one), which is explained via their business dispositions (i.e., technology orientation, result orientation, search orientation) toward accepting technological incertitude.

J	Rajagopalan, S				Rajagopalan, S			Make to order or make to stock: Model and application	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; approximations/heuristics; multi-item; stochastic batch production system	INVENTORY; ITEM	Some firms make all their products to order while others make them to stock. There are a number of firms that maintain a middle ground, where some items are made to stock and others are made to order. This paper was motivated by a consumer product company faced with the decision about which items to make to stock and which ones to make to order, and the inventory and production policy for the make-to-stock items. The production environment is characterized by multiple items, setup times between the production of consecutive items, limited capacity, and congestion effects. In such an environment, making an item to order reduces inventory costs for that item, but might increase the lot size and inventory costs for the items made to stock. Also, lead times increase because of congestion effects, resulting in higher safety stocks for make-to-stock items and lower service levels for make-to-order items, thus leading to a complex trade-off. We develop a nonlinear, integer programming formulation of the problem. We present an efficient heuristic to solve the problem, which was motivated by key results for a special case of the problem without congestion effects that can be solved optimally. We also develop a lower bound to evaluate the performance of the heuristic. A computational study indicates that the heuristic performs well. We discuss the application of the model in a large firm and the resulting insights. We also provide insights into the impact of various problem parameters on the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decisions using a computational study. In particular, we find that the average number of setups of an item selected for make-to-stock production is always less than half the average number of setups of the item if it were to be made to order. Also, factors other than an item's demand, such as its setup time, processing time, and unit holding cost, impact the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decision.

We identify complementarities between the two financial instruments. We test these predictions empirically with panel data on 3,119 corporations in the COMPUSTAT database. Our estimates using instrumental variable techniques support our theoretical predictions regarding the link between internal funds and capital investments, as well as the interaction effects between debt and new equity. We explore implications for managers, financiers, and policy makers.

We allow for a correlated demand stream as we analyze our models in an asymptotic regime, in which the penalty and holding costs are small relative to the cost of capacity Although our approximations are asymptotically correct, our Brownian approximation is accurate even under moderate traffic intensity.

We propose that managers underestimate the full value of some means of pollution reduction and so under exploit these means. Based on evidence from previous studies, we argue that waste prevention often provides unexpected innovation offsets, and that onsite waste treatment often provides unexpected cost. We use statistical methods to test the direction and significance of the relationship between the various means of pollution reduction and profitability. We find strong evidence that waste prevention leads to financial gain, but we find no evidence that firms profit from reducing pollution by other means. Indeed, we find evidence that the benefits of waste prevention alone are responsible for the observed association between lower emissions and profitability.

Specifically, we consider a supplier serving Multiple retailers located in a close proximity. The first effort uses information on the retailers' inventory positions to coordinate shipments from the supplier to enjoy economies of scale in shipments, such as full truckloads. The second effort uses the same information for eventual unloading of the shipments to the retailers to rebalance their stocking positions. How much benefit do we gain from such initiatives?

J	Reinschmidt, KF				Reinschmidt, KF			Aggregate social discount rate derived from individual discount rates	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						social discount rate; public sector investment; benefit-cost analysis		In the economic evaluation of large public-sector projects, an aggregate social discount rate may be used in present worth comparison of alternatives. This paper uses the assumptions that individual discount rates are constant over time and approximately Normally distributed across the affected population, with mean mu and variance sigma(2), to derive an aggregate discount function that is exponential in form but with time-dependent aggregate discount rate p(t) = mu - sigma(2)t/2, where t is the time of occurrence of the cost or benefit. This equation agrees with numerical simulations. If sigma(2) > 0, then the aggregate discount rate is less than the mean individual discount rate, and use of the time-dependent aggregate discount rate p(t) = mu - sigma(2)t/2 instead of the constant discount factor p(t) = mu would result in larger discounted present values for public-sector projects for which the benefits lie far in the future. This could mean that public-sector investments that would be rejected under the assumption p(t) = mu might be justified using the time-dependent aggregate discount rate p(t) = mu - sigma(2)t/2.

We find that public research is critical to industrial R&D in a small number of industries and importantly affects industrial R&D across much of the manufacturing sector. Contrary to the notion that university research largely generates new ideas for industrial R&D projects, the survey responses demonstrate that public research both suggests new R&D projects and contributes to the completion of existing projects in roughly equal measure overall. The results also indicate that the key channels through which university research impacts industrial R&D include published papers and reports, public conferences and meetings, informal information exchange, and consulting. We also find that, after controlling for industry, the influence of public research on industrial R&D is disproportionately greater for larger firms as well as start-ups.

Understanding cross-national differences in the organization of innovative labor in the life sciences requires attention to the structure and evolution of biomedical networks involving public research organizations (universities, government laboratories, nonprofit research institutes, and research hospitals), science-based biotechnology firms, and multinational pharmaceutical corporations. We use network visualization methods and correspondence analyses to demonstrate that innovative research in biomedicine has its origins in regional clusters in the United States and in European nations. But the scientific and organizational composition of these regions varies in consequential ways. In the United States, public research organizations and small firms conduct R&D across multiple therapeutic areas and stages of the development process. Ties within and across these regions link small firms and diverse public institutions, contributing to the development of a robust national network. In contrast, the European story is one of regional specialization with a less diverse group of public research organizations working in a smaller number of therapeutic areas. European institutes develop local connections to small firms working on similar scientific problems, while cross-national linkages of European regional clusters typically involve large pharmaceutical corporations. We show that the roles of large and small firms differ in the United States and Europe, arguing that the greater heterogeneity of the U.S. system is based on much closer integration of basic science and clinical development.

Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, we show that patenting is a minority activity: a majority of the faculty in our sample never patent, and publication rates far outstrip patenting rates. Most faculty members estimate that patents account for less than 10% of the knowledge that transfers from their labs. Our results also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of knowledge generation and transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication volume, and those firms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same firms as those that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively correlated with paper citations, suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact. We close by speculating on the implications of our results for the difficult but important question of whether, in this setting, patenting acts as a substitute or a complement to the process of fundamental research.

Sources of growth in university licensing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on University Entrepreneurship and Technology Transfer	DEC, 2000	GEORGIA INST TECHNOL, DUPREE COLL MANAGEMENT, ATLANTA, GEORGIA		GEORGIA INST TECHNOL, DUPREE COLL MANAGEMENT	university licensing; invention disclosures; patents; entrepreneurial activity	PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; EFFICIENCY	Historically, commercial use of university research has been viewed in terms of spillovers. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in technology transfer through licensing as universities attempt to appropriate the returns from faculty research. This change has prompted concerns regarding the source of this growth-specifically, whether it suggests a change in the nature of university research. We develop an intermediate input model to examine the extent to which the growth in licensing is due to the productivity of observable inputs or driven by a change in the propensity of faculty and administrators to engage in commercializing university research. We model licensing as a three-stage process, each involving multiple inputs. Nonparametric programming techniques are applied to survey data from 64 universities to calculate total factor productivity (TFP) growth in each stage. To examine the sources of TFP growth, the productivity analysis is augmented by survey evidence from businesses who license-in university inventions. Results suggest that increased licensing is due primarily to an increased willingness of faculty and administrators to license and increased business reliance on external R&D rather than a shift in faculty research.

This paper discusses mechanisms available to universities in managing the commercialization of intellectual property, considering equity as a technology transfer mechanism that offers advantages for both generating revenue and aligning the interests of universities, industry and faculty. Employing data from a national survey of Carnegie I and Carnegie II institutions, we document the recent rise in university equity holdings. We present and estimate a model that considers the university's use of equity to be a function of behavioral factors related to the university's prior experiences with licensing, success relative to other institutions, and the organization of the technology transfer office, as well as structural characteristics related to university type.

However, no systematic explanation of the conditions under which university inventions will be licensed or commercialized has been provided. Drawing on transaction cost economics, I provide a conceptual framework to explain which university inventions are most likely to be licensed, commercialized, and generate royalties, and who will undertake that commercialization. I test this framework on data on the 1,397 patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1980-1996 period. The results show that (1) university inventions are more likely to be licensed when patents are effective; (2) when patents are effective, university technology is generally licensed to noninventors; (3) when patents are effective, licensing back to inventors increases the likelihood of license termination and reduces the likelihood of invention commercialization; and (4) the effectiveness of patents increases royalties earned for inventions licensed to noninventors. The implications of these findings for innovation management and strategy, entrepreneurship, and university technology commercialization are discussed.

New codes and formulae describing discoveries develop slowly-with little incentive if value is low and many competing opportunities if high. Hence new knowledge remains naturally excludable and appropriable. Team production allows more knowledge capture of tacit, complex discoveries by firm scientists. A robust indicator of a firm's tacit knowledge capture (and strong predictor of its success) is the number of research articles written jointly by firm scientists and discovering, "star" scientists, nearly all working at top universities. An operationally attractive generalization of our star measure-collaborative research articles between firm scientists and top research university scientists-replicates the impact on firm success. In panel analyses, publications by firm scientists with stars and/or top 112 university scientists increase the number and citation rate for firm patents. Further, star articles increase these rates significantly more than other top 112 university scientists' articles. Cross-sectional analyses of products and employment show a similar pattern of positive effects on firms' success of collaborations with stars or top university scientists, but estimates of differential effects are nonrobust due to multicollinearity. Venture capital funding has significant, usually positive effects on firm success.

Using data on the life histories of all 134 firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions during the 1980-1996 period, the study analyzes how resource endowments affect the likelihood of three critical outcomes: that new ventures attract venture capital financing, experience initial public offerings, and fail. Our analysis focuses on the role of founders' social capital as a determinant of these outcomes. Event history analyses show that new ventures with founders having direct and indirect relationships with venture investors are most likely to receive venture funding and are less likely to fail. In turn, receiving venture funding is the single most important determinant of the likelihood of IPO.

J	Randall, T; Ulrich, K				Randall, T; Ulrich, K			Product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance: Analysis of the US bicycle industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product variety; supply chain structure; firm performance	MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COST; LOCATION; FLEXIBILITY; CHOICE; PLANT	Using data from the U.S. bicycle industry, we examine the relation among product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance. Variety imposes two types of costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product mark-down costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, and the costs of lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact of variety on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some types of variety incur high production costs and some types of variety incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i.e., high-volume firms) will offer types of variety associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer types of variety associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the type of product variety they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.

The goal of the PGM is to develop insights about optimal strategies (i.e., sequential, concurrent, or overlapped) to manage coupled design activities that share a fixed amount of engineering resources subject to performance and deadline constraints. Model analysis characterizes the solution space for the coupled development problem. The solution space is used to explore the generation of product performance and the associated dynamic forces affecting concurrent development practices. We use these forces to explain conditions under which concurrency is a desirable strategy.

The model builds on the argument that more accurate expectations about the firm-specific value of resources is, other than luck, the only way for firms to obtain the specific resources required for competitive advantage. We address the more specific question of what types of information firms should gather to accomplish this goal. The model generates a series of testable hypotheses about how a firm's optimal mix of different types of information is affected by a number of factors, including the level of uncertainty about the value of the resource being acquired; the rarity, imitability and nonsubstitutability of that resource; the level of inscrutability of firms' pre-existing stocks of resources; and firms' information-gathering and information-processing capacities.

J	Shafer, SM; Nembhard, DA; Uzumeri, MV				Shafer, SM; Nembhard, DA; Uzumeri, MV			The effects of worker learning, forgetting, and heterogeneity on assembly line productivity	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						learning; forgetting; worker heterogeneity; simulation	FLEXIBILITY; CURVE; TASK	The authors investigate through several simulations how patterns of learning and forgetting affect the operating performance of an assembly line. A unique aspect of this study is that a distribution of learning/forgetting behavior based on an empirical population of workers is used rather than assuming the same learning pattern for all employees. The paper demonstrates that modeling only central tendency and not the variations across workers tends to systematically underestimate overall productivity. The data used to estimate the parameters for the distribution of learning curves were collected from an assembly line that produces car radios. Analysis of the models fit to a population of workers reveals that higher levels of previous experience are positively correlated with higher steady-state productivity levels and negatively correlated with the learning rate. To further motivate the study, a conceptual model with several factors hypothesized to influence assembly line productivity is presented. Among key factors included in the model are the rate of worker learning, the size of the worker pool, task tenure, and the magnitude of worker forgetting. In controlled computer simulation experiments, each of these factors was found to be statistically significant, as were a number of the two-way interaction terms.

J	Dayanand, N; Padman, R				Dayanand, N; Padman, R			Project contracts and payment schedules: The client's problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							CASH FLOWS	Contractual agreements have assumed significant complexity in recent times because of the emergence of strategies like outsourcing and partnering in the successful completion of large software development, manufacturing, and construction projects. A client and contractor enter into an agreement for a project either by bidding or negotiation. Effective and efficient bidding, negotiation, and subsequent monitoring are hindered by the lack of appropriate decision support tools for the management of project finances. Progress payments to the contractor are an important issue in project management because of their potential impact on project finances and activity schedules. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously determining the amount, location, and timing of progress payments in projects from a client's perspective. We develop three mixed-integer linear programming models, based on some practical methods of determining payment schedules from different types of project contracts. We discuss properties of the models and draw insights about the characteristics of optimal payment schedules obtained with each model by an experimental study on a sample of 10 small projects. Our analysis shows that, contrary to current practice, the client obtains the greatest benefit by scheduling the project for early completion such that the payments are not made at regular intervals. It is also cost effective for the client to make payments either in the early stages of the project or toward the end, even though this causes considerable variation in the time gap between payments. We also evaluate the impact of the client's preferred payment schedules on the contractor's finances and activity schedules, and draw some conclusions on the interdependence of payment and project parameters on the objectives of both parties entering the contractual agreement.

We examine how the possibility of such transshipments between two independent locations affects the optimal inventory orders at each location. If each location aims to maximize its own profits-we call this local decision making-their inventory choices will not, in general, maximize joint profits. We find transshipment prices which induce the locations to choose inventory levels consistent with joint-profit maximization.

The authors present a new optimization framework for this problem, the nested partitions (NP) method. This method is globally convergent and may utilize existing heuristic methods to speed its convergence. We incorporate several known heuristics into this framework and demonstrate through numerical experiments that using the NP method results in superior product designs. Our numerical results suggest that the new framework is particularly useful for designing complex products with many attributes.

Analytical solutions are established for the case when the innovations in the short rate are normal and/or chi-squared random variables and the volatility of rates take on a special GARCH form. GARCH models that nest level-dependent interest rate models, including the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, are also considered. Algorithms are provided that permit the efficient pricing of American-style interest rate claims under a rather broad array of GARCH-Level dependent processes.

To better explain these decision weights, a two-stage approach has been proposed: First, the probability of an event is judged and then this probability is transformed by the probability weighting function known from decision making under risk. We extend the two-stage approach by allowing the probability weighting function to depend on the type of uncertainty. Using this more general approach, properties of decision weights can be attributed to properties of probability judgments and/or to properties of probability weighting. We present an empirical study that shows that it is indeed necessary to allow the probability weighting function to be source dependent. The analysis includes an examination of properties of the probability weighting function under uncertainty that have not been considered yet.

J	Ofek, E; Sarvary, M				Ofek, E; Sarvary, M			Leveraging the customer base: Creating competitive advantage through knowledge management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						increasing returns to scale; network externalities; knowledge management; competition	ADVERTISING AGENCY; INNOVATION; COMPATIBILITY; PRODUCT	Professional services firms (e.g., consultants, accounting firms, or advertising agencies) generate and sell business solutions to their customers. In doing so, they can leverage the cumulative experience gained from serving their customer base to either reduce their variable costs or increase the quality of their products/services. In other words, their "production technology" exhibits some form of increasing returns to scale. Growth and globalization, coupled with recent advances in information technology, have led many of these firms to introduce sophisticated knowledge management (KM) systems in order to create sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, the authors analyze how KM is likely to affect competition among such professional services firms. In particular, they first explore what type (supply-side versus demand-side) of economies of scale are likely to be exploited in KM systems. In the former case, KM's role is to reduce the operating costs of the firm, while in the latter case, its role is to create added value to customers by significantly increasing product quality. Second, the authors analyze the competitive dynamics and market structure that emerge as a result of firms competing with KM systems. The results shed light on the current literature exploring the deployment of KM systems by suggesting that in a competitive setting, when firms' ability to leverage their customer base is high, KM should lead to quality improvement rather than cost reductions. In a dynamic setting, it is also shown that when firms use their KM system to improve product quality, higher ability to leverage the customer base may actually hurt profits and lead to industry shakeout. Beyond normative insights, the results also support a number of recent market trends in management consulting, including the increased emphasis on knowledge-creating activities in modern KM systems, the wave of mergers between consulting firms, and the recent emergence of "retail consulting" services.

While prior research in the auditing literature has recognized the applicability of a Bayesian belief revision framework for many audit tasks, empirical evidence has suggested that auditors' cognitive decision processes often violate probability axioms. We believe that some of the well-documented cognitive limitations of a human auditor can be compensated by an automated system. In particular, we demonstrate that a formal belief revision scheme can be incorporated into an automated system to provide reliable probability estimates for early warning of bank failures. The automated system examines financial ratios as predictors of a bank's performance and assesses the posterior probability of a banks financial health (alternatively, financial distress). We examine two different probabilistic models, one that is simpler and makes more assumptions, while the other that is somewhat more complex but makes fewer assumptions. We find that both models are able to make accurate predictions with the help of historical data to estimate the required probabilities. In particular, the more complex model is found to be very well calibrated in its probability estimates. We posit that such a model can serve as a useful decision aid to an auditor's judgment process.

J	Feinberg, FM				Feinberg, FM			On continuous-time optimal advertising under S-shaped response	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						advertising models; optimal control; contagion; diffusion models; S-Shaped response	OPTIMAL-CONTROL MODELS; STATE	Continuous-time monopolistic models of advertising expenditure that rely on strict response concavity have been shown to prescribe eventual spending at a constant rate. However, analyses of discrete analogs have suggested that S-shaped response (convexity for low expenditure levels) may allow for the periodic optima encountered in actual practice. Casting the dynamic between advertising and sales in a common format (an autonomous, first-order relationship), the present paper explores extensions along three dimensions: an S-shaped response function, the value of the discount rate, and the possibility of diffusionlike response. Supplementing the treatment by Mahajan and Muller (1986), a flexible class of S-shaped response models is formulated for which it is demonstrated that, in contrast to findings in the literature on discretized advertising models, continuous periodic optima cannot be supported. Further, a set of conditions on the advertising response function are derived, that contains and extends that suggested by Sasieni (1971). Collectively, these results both suggest a set of baseline properties that reasonable models should possess and cast doubt on the ability of first-order models to capture effects of known managerial relevance.

J	Dana, JD; Petruzzi, NC				Dana, JD; Petruzzi, NC			Note: The newsvendor model with endogenous demand	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						newsvendor model; inventory; demand uncertainty; pricing; service rate competition; fill rate competition; service levels	LEVEL-DEPENDENT DEMAND; PRICE; UNCERTAINTY; EQUILIBRIUM; CAPACITY	This paper considers a firm's price and inventory policy when it faces uncertain demand that depends on both price and inventory level. The authors extend the classic newsvendor model by assuming that expected utility maximizing consumers choose between visiting the firm an consuming an exogenous, outside option. The outside option represents the utility the consumer forgoes when she chooses to visit the firm before-knowing whether or not the product will be available. The authors investigate both the case in which the firm's price is exogenous and the case in which price is chosen optimally. The paper makes two contributions. First, the authors show that the firm holds more inventories, provides a higher fill rate, attracts more customers, and earns higher profits when it internalizes the effect of its inventory on demand. Second, the authors show that in the endogenous price case the firm's two-dimensional decision problem can be reduced to two, sequential, single-variable optimizations. As a result, the endogenous-price case is as easy to solve as the exogenous-price case.

J	Bleichrodt, H; Pinto, JL; Wakker, PP				Bleichrodt, H; Pinto, JL; Wakker, PP			Making descriptive use of prospect theory to improve the prescriptive use of expected utility	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						utility elicitation; probability transformation; loss aversion	PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FUNCTION; PARAMETER-FREE ELICITATION; HEALTH-STATE UTILITIES; DECISION-ANALYSIS; RISKY CHOICE; PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY; FRAMEWORK; REDUCTION; BIASES	This paper proposes a quantitative modification of standard utility elicitation procedures, such as the probability and certainty equivalence methods, to correct for commonly observed violations of expected utility. Traditionally, decision analysis assumes expected utility not only for the prescriptive purpose of calculating optimal decisions but also for the descriptive purpose of eliciting utilities. However, descriptive violations of expected utility bias utility elicitations. That such biases are effective became clear when systematic discrepancies were found between different utility elicitation methods that, under expected utility, should have yielded identical utilities. As it is not clear how to correct for these biases without further knowledge of their size or nature, most utility elicitations still calculate utilities by means of the expected utility formula. This paper speculates on the biases and their sizes by using the quantitative assessments of probability transformation and loss aversion suggested by prospect theory. It presents quantitative corrections for the probability and certainty equivalence methods. If interactive sessions to correct for biases are not possible, then the authors propose to use the corrected utilities rather than the uncorrected ones in prescriptions of optimal decisions. In an experiment, the discrepancies between the probability and certainty equivalence methods are removed by the authors' proposal.

J	Huang, S; Yang, Y; Anderson, K				Huang, S; Yang, Y; Anderson, K			A theory of finitely durable goods monopoly with used-goods market and transaction costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						durable goods; transaction costs; leasing and selling; intertemporal price discrimination; Markov perfect equilibrium	COASE CONJECTURE; PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; DYNAMIC OLIGOPOLY; DEPRECIATION; COMPETITION; DEMAND	We construct a dynamic game to model a monopoly of finitely durable goods. The solution concept is Markov-perfect equilibria with general equilibria embedded in every time period. Our model is flexible enough to simultaneously explain or accommodate many commonly observed phenomena or stylized facts, such as concurrent leasing and selling, active secondary markets for used goods, heterogeneous consumers, endogenous consumption patterns, depreciation, an infinite time horizon, and nontrivial transaction costs. Within our model, consumers have incentives to segment themselves into various consumption classes according to their willingness to pay, and nontrivial transaction costs to sell used goods put strong constraints on consumers' consumption sequences in time. As a direct consequence of the finite durability, the market power of the monopolist remains intact. Leasing manifests itself as a facilitator of price discrimination by debundling the durable good into new and used portions that are naturally bundled together under outright sales. The concurrent leasing and selling reflects the degree of the comparative advantage the monopolist has over consumers in disposing used goods. This comparative advantage, which is partially exploited by the monopolist and partially shared by the consumers, provides a sufficient mechanism to gain Pareto improvement on the market.

To validate such a simulation, this paper focuses on the difference between the average simulated and real responses. To evaluate this validation statistic, the paper develops a novel bootstrap technique-based on replicated runs. This validation statistic and the bootstrap technique are evaluated in extensive Monte Carlo experiments with specific single-server queues. These experiments show acceptable Type-I and Type-II error probabilities.

J	Li, L; Porteus, EL; Zhang, HT				Li, L; Porteus, EL; Zhang, HT			Optimal operating policies for multiplant stochastic manufacturing systems in a changing environment	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						global manufacturing; multiplant operations; optimal policy; exchange rate; production/inventory	DELIVERY-TIME COMPETITION; FLEXIBILITY	This paper addresses the horizontal coordination between production units located in different countries within a supply chain in a changing environment. The model incorporates (1) congestion and delay through uncertainties in demand and processing times, (2) a changing production cost environment through uncertainty in an environmental state (such as the exchange rate), and (3) allowing production to stock. The main contribution of the paper is to characterize the optimal production policy, assuming no switchover cost, as a barrier-type control policy for a series of models. For each plant, there is a barrier function defined on the environmental state that gives the total worldwide stock level barrier: This plant should be operated if and only if the stock level is below this barrier. The authors also show that, in a simple setting of two plants in different countries, the barrier functions are not always monotone in the exchange rate even when the production costs are. The authors present a condition under which the control barriers are shown to be monotone. Under this condition and with only two plants, it is optimal to follow a primary/secondary plant policy in which, given a fixed environmental state, it is optimal to operate both plants when stock is low, only the primary plant when stock is moderate, and neither when stock is high. Furthermore, the roles of the plants switch as the environmental state passes through the equal production cost state. In addition, the firm seeks to carry the most stock as a hedge against future environmental state moves, when one plant is significantly cheaper than the other. The firm seeks to carry the least stock when both plants are equally costly to operate.

J	Kornish, LJ				Kornish, LJ			Pricing for a durable-goods monopolist under rapid sequential innovation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product pricing; upgrades; technological improvement	PRODUCTS; UPGRADES	A durable-goods monopolist who will be introducing new and improved versions of his product must decide how to price his products, keeping in mind the relative attractiveness of the current and future products. Dhebar (1994) has shown that if technology is changing too quickly and the producer cannot credibly commit to future prices and quality, then no equilibrium strategy exists. That is, there is no credible strategy for the future product that the producer can commit to in the first period. We show that an equilibrium pricing strategy exists if the monopolist does not offer upgrade pricing, that is, special pricing to consumers who have bought an earlier version. The author shows the possible purchase patterns in equilibrium and derives the optimal pricing strategy.

J	Rajagopalan, S; Swaminathan, JM				Rajagopalan, S; Swaminathan, JM			A coordinated production planning model with capacity expansion and inventory management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						production planning; multiproduct inventory; capacity expansion; equipment purchase; mathematical programming; heuristics	LOT SCHEDULING PROBLEM; TIMES	Motivated by a problem faced by a large manufacturer of a consumer product, we explore the interaction between production planning and capacity acquisition decisions in environments with demand growth. We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights-increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase In set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity We also provide solutions and insights to the real problem that motivated this work.

This article identifies a production line specifically set up to create technological knowledge about its production function through scientific experimentation (formal learning) as opposed to learning by doing. The organizational structure of this line was very successful in creating technological knowledge. Formal learning resulted in huge productivity improvements. Replication of this organizational structure on three production lines in other plants within the same firm fell short of expectations. Formal learning did not result in similar productivity improvements. Our research suggests two factors that may facilitate creation and transfer of technological knowledge: management buy-in and knowledge diversity to solve interdepartmental problems.

J	Aviv, Y				Aviv, Y			The effect of collaborative forecasting on supply chain performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						collaborative forecasting; CFAR; CPFR; supply chain management	INVENTORY MODELS; DEMAND; POLICIES; INFORMATION; OPTIMALITY	We consider a cooperative, two-stage supply chain consisting of two members: a retailer and a supplier. In our first model, called local forecasting, each member updates the forecasts of future demands periodically, and is able to integrate the adjusted forecasts into his replenishment process. Forecast adjustments made at both levels of the supply chain can be correlated. The supply chain has a decentralized information structure, so that day-to-day inventory and forecast information are known locally only. In our second model, named collaborative forecasting, the supply chain members jointly maintain and update a single forecasting process in the system. Hence, forecasting information becomes centralized. Finally, we consider as a benchmark the special case in which forecasts are not integrated into the replenishment processes at all. We propose a unified framework that allows us to study and compare the three types of settings. This study comes at a time when various types of collaborative forecasting partnerships are being experimented within industry, and when the drivers for success or failure of such initiatives are not yet fully understood.

J	Gallego, G; Ozer, O				Gallego, G; Ozer, O			Integrating replenishment decisions with advance demand information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic inventory systems; advance demand information; demand lead times	INVENTORY CONTROL; POLICIES; OPTIMALITY; EVOLUTION; MODELS	There is a growing consensus that a portfolio of customers with different demand lead times can lead to higher, more regular revenues and better capacity utilization. Customers with positive demand lead times place orders in advance of their needs, resulting in advance demand information. This gives rise to the problem of finding effective inventory control policies under advance demand information. We show that state-dependent (s, S) and base-stock policies are optimal for stochastic inventory systems with and without fixed costs. The state of the system reflects our knowledge of advance demand information. We also determine conditions under which advance demand information has no operational value. A numerical study allows us to obtain additional insights and to evaluate strategies to induce advance demand information.

J	Ortega, J				Ortega, J			Job rotation as a learning mechanism	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						job rotation; learning	WORK	This article analyzes the costs and benefits of job rotation as a mechanism with which the firm can learn about the employees' productivities and the profitability of different jobs or activities. I compare job rotation to an assignment policy where employees specialize in one job along their career. The gains from adopting a job rotation policy are larger when there is more prior uncertainty about employees and activities. I argue that this firm learning theory fits the existing evidence on rotation better than alternative explanations based on employee motivation and employee learning.

J	Kukreja, A; Schmidt, CP; Miller, DM				Kukreja, A; Schmidt, CP; Miller, DM			Stocking decisions for low-usage items in a multilocation inventory system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory control; pooling; multi-echelon models; state-dependent rates	EMERGENCY LATERAL TRANSSHIPMENTS; ONE-PERIOD; MULTIPERIOD; POLICIES	This research shows that organizations with a number of "sister" plants, warehouses, or other stocking points can profit from the concept of proactive use of transshipments as an element of their inventory control policy. For certain types of parts, employing transshipments can significantly reduce the total inventory needed throughout the entire collection of stocking points. The study is motivated by a real-life situation involving a large utility company having 29 power-generating plants in five Southeastern states where there are thousands of parts that are commonly used at multiple plants. At present, each plant operates independently and maintains enough stock to meet its own requirements. Transshipments take place between plants whenever there is an emergency requirement for a part, but no explicit consideration is given to this effect while deciding on stocking levels at different plants. In the case we examined, by setting stocking levels to explicitly take account of transshipments, total system cost could be reduced by about 70% over the company's decentralized policy. In general, this work considers a single-echelon, N-location, continuous-review inventory system in which complete pooling of stock is permitted among the locations. A model is developed for slow-moving, expensive, and consumable parts that are common to two or more locations. A one-for-one ordering policy and queueing theory allow development and solution of a system of equations for the probability distribution of net inventory at each location. A heuristic procedure is also developed to determine cost-effective stocking levels. Actual data from the utility company are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Savings achieved as a result of pooling are reported.

J	Lee, CY; Cetinkaya, S; Wagelmans, APM				Lee, CY; Cetinkaya, S; Wagelmans, APM			A dynamic lot-sizing model with demand time windows	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lot sizing; dynamic programming; time windows	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; SIZE MODEL; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; SCHEDULING PROBLEMS; COMMON; COSTS; N)	One of the basic assumptions of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that the aggregate demand of a given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed, then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but it can be delivered later at the expense of a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real-life applications, the customer offers a grace period-we call it a demand time window-during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an acceptable earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window. This paper studies the dynamic lot-sizing problem with demand time windows and provides polynomial time algorithms for computing its solution. If backlogging is not allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T-2) where T is the length of the planning horizon. When backlogging is allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T-3).

Very often, there exists a natural symmetry inherent in the problem itself that, if propagated to the model, can hopelessly mire a branch-and-bound solver by burdening it to explore and eliminate such alternative symmetric solutions. We discuss three applications where such a symmetry arises: a telecommunications network design problem, a noise pollution problem, and a machine procurement and operation problem. For each case, we identify the indistinguishable objects in the model that create the problem symmetry and show how imposing certain decision hierarchies within the model significantly enhances its solvability, while using a popular modern-day commercial branch-and-cut software (CPLEX 6.5).

J	Kara, BY; Tansel, BC				Kara, BY; Tansel, BC			The latest arrival hub location problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						hub location; minimax; latest arrival	MEDIAN PROBLEM; SPOKE NETWORK	The traditionally studied hub location problems in the literature pay attention to flight times but not to transient times spent at hubs for unloading, loading, and sorting operations. The transient times may constitute a significant portion of the total delivery time for cargo delivery systems. We focus on the minimization of the arrival time of the last arrived item in cargo delivery systems and develop a model that correctly computes the arrival times by taking into account both the flight times and the transient times. Nonlinear and linear integer formulations are given and computational results are provided. The effects of delays on the system performance are analyzed.

We assume that travel times between different service facilities are negligible, that each server can work on only one job at a time, and that several servers can work together on one job. We show that when the service rates depend only on either the server or the station (and not both), then all nonidling server assignment policies are optimal. Moreover, for a Markovian system with two stations in tandem and two servers, we show that the optimal policy assigns one server to each station unless that station is blocked or starved (in which case the server helps at the other station), and we specify the criterion used for assigning servers to stations. Finally, we propose a simple server assignment policy for tandem systems in which the number of stations equals the number of servers, and we present numerical results that show that our policy appears to yield near-optimal throughput under general conditions.

J	Shane, S				Shane, S			Technology regimes and new firm formation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						entrepreneurship; technology regimes; patents	INNOVATION; APPROPRIABILITY; TIME	At least since Schumpeter (1934 and 1942), researchers have been interested in identifying the dimensions of technology regimes that facilitate new firm formation as a mode of technology exploitation. Using data on 1,397 patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1980-1996. period, I show that four hypothesized dimensions of the technology regime-the age of the technical field, the tendency of the market toward segmentation, the effectiveness of patents, and the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribution-influence the likelihood that new technology will be exploited through firm formation.

Based on several converging theoretical perspectives, we present and test a model relating vehicle initial quality ratings to consumers' routine maintenance. Three types of data were collected for the study: (1) vehicle service records at a local dealership, (2) primary data from a survey of vehicle owners, and (3) Consumer Reports data on quality ratings and initial purchase prices. The results of a structural equation analysis of the proposed model indicate a significant link between quality and customers' quality behavior. This link has important strategic implications for both automotive manufacturers and distributors, particularly as "leasing" becomes more prevalent in the industry.

J	Ba, SL; Stallaert, J; Whinston, AB				Ba, SL; Stallaert, J; Whinston, AB			Optimal investment in knowledge within a firm using a market mechanism	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						mechanism design; knowledge sharing; incentive compatibility; public goods; bundle auction; knowledge investment	AUCTIONS; ALLOCATION; MODELS	There has been an extensive research literature on auctions, but recent developments in technology have resulted in new interest in auction mechanisms as a practical way of allocating resources. This paper presents a new double-auction mechanism to handle resource allocation for public goods when complementarity exists. The mechanism is placed in the context of an organization's internal knowledge investment. Knowledge goods have two distinct Characteristics. First, knowledge within an organization can be considered a public good, so it is subject to the free-rider problem. Second, knowledge is interrelated and interdependent; that is, there is complementarity among knowledge components. The value of knowledge often derives from a bundle of knowledge components, rather than from its individual pieces. These two characteristics present a serious challenge to allocating organizational resources for knowledge goods. We introduce an internal market in which knowledge providers offer knowledge projects and knowledge consumers place bids to acquire them. The mechanism is a Groves-Clarke-type double auction that allows bundled knowledge goods to be traded so as to recognize complementarities between knowledge projects. The market mechanism we propose is incentive compatible; i.e., it induces people to reveal their true valuation. In addition, it allows trades of knowledge bundles to determine which knowledge components are most valuable from the organization's viewpoint. Under mild assumptions, the mechanism is a computationally tractable solution to operating a market of bundled public goods. We further show how "imputed prices" can be calculated for subsets of knowledge components and prove that a market mechanism that does not allow bundle orders or does not address the free-rider problem yields a systematic underinvestment in knowledge.

J	Taylor, TA				Taylor, TA			Channel coordination under price protection, midlife returns, and end-of-life returns in dynamic markets	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						channel coordination; supply chain management; incentives; inventory management	FLEXIBILITY	This paper examines three channel policies that are used in declining price environments: Price protection (P) is a mechanism under which the manufacturer pays the retailer a credit applying to the retailer's unsold inventory when the wholesale price drops during the life cycle; midlife returns (M) allow the retailer to return units partway through the life cycle at some rebate; and end-of-life returns (E) allow the retailer to return unsold units at the end of the life cycle. Under declining retail prices, if the wholesale prices and the return rebates are set properly, then EM (i.e., midlife and end-of-life returns) achieves channel coordination. However, such a policy may not be implementable because it may require the manufacturer to be worse off as a result of coordination. If P is used in addition to EM and the terms are set properly, then PEM guarantees both coordination and a win-win outcome. If the retail price is constant over time, then EM is sufficient to guarantee both coordination and a win-win outcome.

This can be relevant in situations with multiple decision makers or when decisions must be prescribed under memory constraints, such as in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We give an algorithm for improving any given strategy by local computation of single policy updates and investigate conditions for the resulting strategy to be optimal.

J	Teo, CP; Sethuraman, J; Tan, WP				Teo, CP; Sethuraman, J; Tan, WP			Gale-Shapley stable marriage problem revisited: Strategic issues and applications	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stable marriage; strategic issues; Gale-Shapley algorithm; student posting exercise	MATCHING MARKETS; STABILITY	We study strategic issues in the Gale-Shapley stable marriage model. Iri the first part of the paper, we derive the optimal cheating strategy and show that it is not always possible for a woman to recover her women-optimal stable partner from the men-optimal stable matching mechanism when she can only cheat by permuting her preferences. In fact, we show, using simulation, that the chances that a woman can benefit from cheating are slim. In the second part of the paper, we consider a two-sided matching market found in Singapore. We study the matching mechanism used by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the placement of primary six students in secondary schools, and discuss why the current method has limited success in accommodating the preferences of the students, and the specific needs of the schools (in terms of the "mix" of admitted students). Using insights from the first part of the paper, we show that stable matching mechanisms are more appropriate in this matching market and explain why the strategic behavior of the students need not be a major concern.

J	Toktay, LB; Wein, LM				Toktay, LB; Wein, LM			Analysis of a forecasting-production-inventory system with stationary demand	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						forecasting; martingale model of forecast evolution; production/inventory; stochastic models; queues; diffusion models	SAFETY STOCK; MODEL; INFORMATION; EVOLUTION; POLICIES; IMPACT	We consider a production stage that produces a single item in a make-to-stock manner. Demand for finished goods is stationary. In each time period, an updated vector of demand forecasts over the forecast horizon becomes available for use in production decisions. We model the sequence of forecast update vectors using the Martingale model of forecast evolution developed by Graves et al. (1986, 1998) and Heath and Jackson (1994). The production stage is modeled as a single-server, discrete-time, continuous-state queue. We focus on a modified base-stock policy incorporating forecast information and use an approximate analysis rooted in heavy traffic theory and random walk theory to obtain a closed-form expression for the (forecast-corrected) base-stock level that minimizes the expected steady-state inventory holding and backorder costs. This expression, which is shown to be accurate under certain conditions in a simulation study, sheds some light on the interrelationships among safety stock, stochastic correlated demand, inaccurate forecasts, and random and capacitated production in forecasting-production-inventory systems.

Our explanation hinges on differences in consumer knowledge about reliability of established and newer products.

J	Stojkovic, M; Soumis, F				Stojkovic, M; Soumis, F			An optimization model for the simultaneous operational flight and pilot scheduling problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						airline; crew scheduling; flight scheduling; aircraft rowing; shortest path; time windows; column generation	SHORTEST-PATH; ALGORITHM	This paper describes and solves the operational pilot scheduling problem for one day of operations. The problem consists in simultaneously modifying, as necessary, the existing flight departure schedules and planned individual work days (duties) while keeping planned aircraft itineraries unchanged. It requires the covering of all flights from one day of operations with available pilots while minimizing changes in both the flight schedule and the next day's planned duties. The newly constructed personalized duties must not exceed the maximum duty duration. Flight precedence constraints, coming from existing fixed aircraft itineraries, must be respected as well. The problem is mathematically formulated as an integer nonlinear multicommodity network flow model with time windows and additional constraints. To solve the problem, a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition combined with a branch-and-bound method has been used. The master problem comprises the flight-covering constraints and a new set of flight precedence constraints. Subproblems consisting of time-constrained shortest-path problems with linear time costs are solved by a specialized dynamic-programming algorithm. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on several input data sets. All of them have been successfully solved in very short computational time.

The model is optimized by an approximate technique. This note provides a simple procedure for exact optimization, and illustrates that the errors when using the suggested approximate technique may be very large for certain types of problems. We also suggest a new approximation and an adjustment that can be used to improve both the original and new heuristic.

We show how connectionist models can be used to simulate the adaptive nature of agents' learning exhibiting similar behavior as practically experienced learning curves. We study the impact of incentive schemes (local, hybrid, and global) on the new product development process for different types of organizations. Sequential organizational structures are compared to two different types of team-based organizations, incorporating methods of quality function deployment such as the house of quality. A key finding of this analysis is that the firms' organizational structure and agents' incentive system significantly interact. We show that the house of quality is less affected by the incentive scheme than firms using a trial and error approach. This becomes an important factor for new product success when the agents' performance measures are conflicting.

J	Milner, JM; Pinker, EJ				Milner, JM; Pinker, EJ			Contingent labor contracting under demand and supply uncertainty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						labor supply; contract analysis; stochastic; staffing strategy	WORK-FORCE	Firms increasingly use contingent labor to flexibly respond to demand in many environments. Labor supply agencies are growing to fill this need. As a result, firms and agencies are engaging in long-term contracts for labor supply. We develop mathematical models of the interaction between firms and labor supply agencies when demand and supply are uncertain. We consider two models of labor supply uncertainty, termed productivity and availability uncertainty, and study how each affects the nature of the contracts formed. These models reflect two major roles played by the labor supply agency. In the case of productivity uncertainty we find that it is possible to construct a contract that coordinates the firm and agency hiring in an optimal way. In contrast, we show that in environments characterized by availability uncertainty, optimal contracts are not possible. However, there is a large range of contract parameters for which both parties would benefit from a contract. We analyze these and discuss the trade-offs that should be considered in contract negotiation.

Among the strategies considered are exporting (EXP), joint ventures with local partners (JV), and wholly owned production facilities (WOS) in the foreign country. Our research takes a first step in modeling the influence of exchange rates on the choice and dynamic adjustment of such strategies. The insights obtained from our modeling analysis are then translated into testable hypotheses and empirically verified with the use of firm level data from U.S. multinational corporations (both at the firm and a more aggregate level). An insightful result of our model is the identification of a hysteresis phenomenon that characterizes switching behavior between strategies in the presence of switchover cost. The magnitude of the hysteresis band, which is a measure of the inertia associated with keeping the current ownership structure, is affected by a multiplicity of factors such as exchange rate volatility and market power of the entering firm. Analytical and numerical results on the effects of such factors on the hysteresis band are provided. The four testable hypotheses generated from our modeling analysis are rigorously tested with the use of a multinomial logit model on data obtained from the Harvard Multinational Enterprise database, and a data set maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Department of Commerce. The empirical results strongly support our insights that relatively depreciated real exchange rates (i.e., weak home currency) favor (a) the JV over the WOS and (b) EXP mode over the WOS or JV Finally, we summarize our results into useful guidelines for global production managers.

J	Atamturk, A; Hochbaum, DS				Atamturk, A; Hochbaum, DS			Capacity acquisition, subcontracting, and lot sizing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						algorithms; extreme points of polyhedra; nonspeculative costs	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; DUPLICATION; COMPLEXITY; SELECTION; TIME; N)	The fundamental question encountered in acquiring capacity to meet nonstationary demand over a multiperiod horizon is how to balance the trade-off between having insufficient capacity in some periods and excess capacity in others. In the former situation, part of the demand is subcontracted while, in the latter, capacity that has been paid for is rendered idle. Capacity and subcontracting decisions arise in many economic activities ranging from production capacity planning in semiconductor fabs to leasing communication networks, from transportation contracts to staffing of call centers. In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between acquiring capacity, subcontracting, production, and holding inventory to satisfy nonstationary demand over a finite horizon. We present capacity acquisition models with holding and without holding inventory and identify forecast-robust properties of the models that restrict the dependence of optimal capacity decisions on the demand forecasts. We develop algorithms for numerous practical cost structures involving variable and fixed charges and prove that they all have polynomial time complexity.

J	Godfrey, GA; Powell, WB				Godfrey, GA; Powell, WB			An adaptive, distribution-free algorithm for the newsvendor problem with censored demands, with applications to inventory and distribution	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						newsvendor problem; censored demands; stochastic programming; dynamic programming approximations	STOCHASTIC PROGRAMS; SINGLE-PERIOD; STOCKOUTS	We consider the problem of optimizing inventories for problems where the demand distribution is unknown, and where it does not necessarily follow a standard form such as the normal. We address problems where the process of deciding the inventory, and then realizing the demand, occurs repeatedly. The only information we use is the amount of inventory left over. Rather than attempting to estimate the demand distribution, we directly estimate the value function using a technique called the Concave, Adaptive Value Estimation (CAVE) algorithm. CAVE constructs a sequence of concave piecewise linear approximations using sample gradients of the recourse function at different points in the domain. Since it is a sampling-based method, CAVE does not require knowledge of the underlying sample distribution. The result is a nonlinear approximation that is more responsive than traditional linear stochastic quasi-gradient methods and more flexible than analytical techniques that require distribution information. In addition, we demonstrate near-optimal behavior of the CAVE approximation in experiments involving two different types of stochastic programs the newsvendor stochastic inventory problem and two-stage distribution problems.

J	Vanhoucke, M; Demeulemeester, E; Herroelen, W				Vanhoucke, M; Demeulemeester, E; Herroelen, W			On maximizing the net present value of a project under renewable resource constraints	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						resource-constrained project scheduling; discounted cash flows; branch-and-bound	DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; BOUND PROCEDURE	In this paper we study the resource-constrained project-scheduling problem with discounted cash flows. Each activity of this resource-constrained project-scheduling problem has certain resource requirements and a known deterministic cash flow that can be either positive or negative. Deterministic cash flows are assumed to occur over the duration of the activities. Progress payments and cash outflows occur at the completion of activities. The objective is to schedule the activities subject to a fixed deadline to maximize the net present value subject to the precedence and resource constraints. With these features the financial aspects of project management are taken into account. We introduce a depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm that makes use of extra precedence relations to resolve a number of resource conflicts and a fast recursive search algorithm for the max-npv problem to compute upper bounds. The recursive search algorithm exploits the idea that positive cash flows should be scheduled as early as possible while negative cash flows should be scheduled as late as possible within the precedence constraints. The procedure has been coded in Visual C++, Version 4.0 under Windows NT, and has been validated on two problem sets.

J	Duan, JC; Gauthier, G; Simonato, JG				Duan, JC; Gauthier, G; Simonato, JG			Asymptotic distribution of the EMS option price estimator	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Monte Carlo; empirical martingale simulation; linear control variate; options	SECURITIES	Monte Carlo simulation is commonly used for computing prices of derivative securities when an analytical solution does not exist. Recently, a new simulation technique known as empirical martingale simulation (EMS) has been proposed by Duan and Simonato (1998) as a way of improving simulation accuracy. EMS has one drawback however. Because of the dependency among sample paths created by the EMS adjustment, the standard error of the price estimate is not readily available from using one simulation sample. In this paper, we develop a scheme to estimate the EMS accuracy. The EMS price estimator is first shown to have an asymptotically normal distribution. Through a simulation study, we then find that the asymptotic normal distribution serves as a good approximation for samples consisting of as few as 500 simulation paths.

J	Chick, SE; Inoue, K				Chick, SE; Inoue, K			New procedures to select the best simulated system using common random numbers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multiple selection; ranking and selection; discrete-event simulation; common random numbers; missing data; Bayesian statistics	MULTIPLE COMPARISONS; SUBSET	Although simulation is widely used to select the best of several alternative system designs, and common random numbers is an important tool for reducing the computation effort of simulation experiments, there are surprisingly few tools available to help a simulation practitioner select the best system when common random numbers are employed. This paper presents new two-stage procedures that use common random numbers to help identify the best simulated system. The procedures allow for screening and attempt to allocate additional replications to improve the value of information obtained during the second stage, rather than determining the number of replications required to provide a given probability of correct selection guarantee. The procedures allow decision makers to reduce either the expected opportunity cost associated with potentially selecting an inferior system, or the probability of incorrect selection. A small empirical study indicates that the new procedures outperform several procedures with respect to several criteria, and identifies potential areas for further improvement.

In this paper, we investigate the time interval effect when one of the variables is additive and one is multiplicative. We prove that the squared multiperiod correlation coefficient (rho (2)(n)) decreases monotonically as n increases, and approaches zero when n goes n to infinity. However, for relevant data corresponding to the U.S. stock market index, when shifting from weekly parameters to quarterly parameters the decrease in rho (2)(n) is negligible. n The effect on the regression coefficient is much more dramatic and even a shift from weekly data to quarterly data affects the regression coefficient substantially. The regression slope generally approaches zero, minus infinity or plus infinity, as the number of periods increases. Montonicity, however, exists only in certain cases.

J	Bennell, JA; Dowsland, KA				Bennell, JA; Dowsland, KA			Hybridising tabu search with optimisation techniques for irregular stock cutting	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						irregular stock cutting; packing problems; tabu search; linear programming	POLYGONS	Sequential meta-heuristic implementations for the irregular stock-cutting problem have highlighted a number of common problems. The literature suggests a consensus that it is more efficient to allow configurations with overlapping pieces in the solution space and to penalise these in the evaluation function. However, depending on the severity of the penalty this relaxation results in a tendency to converge toward infeasible solutions or to seek out feasible solutions at the expense of overall quality. A further problem is encountered in defining a neighbourhood search strategy that can deal with the infinite solution space inherent in the irregular stock-cutting problem. The implementation in this paper adopts a hybrid tabu search approach that incorporates two very different optimisation routines that utilise alternative neighbourhoods to address the described problems.

J	Corbett, CJ; DeCroix, GA				Corbett, CJ; DeCroix, GA			Shared-savings contracts for indirect materials in supply chains: Channel profits and environmental impacts	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply-chain management; supply contracts; shared savings; game theory; environmental management; indirect materials	MORAL-HAZARD; MANAGEMENT	There are many materials for which the quantity needed by a firm is at best indirectly related to the quantity of final product produced by that firm, such as solvents in manufacturing processes or office supplies. For any such "indirect" materials, an inescapable incentive conflict exists: The buyer wishes to minimize consumption of these indirect materials, while the supplier's profits depend on increasing volume. Both buyer and supplier can exert effort to reduce consumption, hence making the overall supply chain more efficient. However, no supplier will voluntarily participate unless contract terms are fundamentally revised. This can be done through a variety of "shared-savings" contracts, where both parties profit from a consumption reduction. This paper analyzes several such contracts currently in use for chemicals purchasing. We show that such contracts can always increase supply-chain profits but need not lead to reduced consumption. We analyze equilibrium effort levels, consumption, and total profits, and show how these change with the contract parameters. We find that the goals of maximizing joint profits and minimizing consumption are generally not aligned. Also, surprisingly, a decrease in a cost parameter can lead to a decrease in profits; it may be necessary (but is always possible) to renegotiate the shared-savings contract to reap the benefits of a cost decrease.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index for services fell in 2000 to 69.4%, down 5 percentage points from 1994. We hypothesize that the characteristics of services-inseparability intangibility and labor intensity-interact with management practices to bias service providers toward reducing the level of service they deliver, often locking entire industries into a vicious cycle of eroding service standards. To explore this proposition we develop a formal model that integrates the structural elements of service delivery. We use econometric estimation, interviews, observations, and archival data to calibrate the model for a consumer-lending service center in a major bank in the United Kingdom. We find that temporary imbalances between service capacity and demand interact with decision rules for effort allocation, capacity management, overtime, and quality aspirations to yield permanent erosion of the service standards and loss of revenue. We explore policies to improve performance and implications for organizational design in the service sector.

J	Ha, AY				Ha, AY			Optimal pricing that coordinates queues with customer-chosen service requirements	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; incentive; delay cost; service facility; joint production; optimal design of queues	PROCESSOR SHARING SYSTEMS; INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY; QUEUING-SYSTEMS; EXTERNALITIES; EQUILIBRIUM; ALLOCATION	This article considers the problem of coordinating the admission rates and service requirements of a multiclass queue when these decisions are made on a decentralized basis. The customer classes are characterized by different demand patterns, delay costs, and service costs. Customers make individual decisions on whether to join the queue and, if so, their service requirements. Their class identities and service requirements are private information not known to the system manager. We develop a two-stage decision framework to analyze the problem and characterize the optimal admission rates and service requirements under both centralized and decentralized assumptions. We distinguish admission and service externality costs that lead to suboptimal performance under decentralized control. For a given service discipline, we derive optimal class-specific pricing schemes that can coordinate the system when only service requirements but not class identities are unobservable. When customer class identities are also unobservable, we consider two common service disciplines that offer undifferentiated service: processor sharing and first-come-first-served. Based on the general framework, for the M/G/s processor sharing queue, we show that a single variable fee (payment per unit of time in the system) can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. For the M/G/1 first-come-first-served queue, we show that a single pricing scheme that is quadratic in time in service can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. Our result demonstrates that, under suitable conditions, simple and undifferentiated pricing can coordinate complex queueing systems with heterogeneous customer classes.

J	Klausner, A; Pollak, M				Klausner, A; Pollak, M			Comparative reliability of verdicts	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						posterior reliability; Bayes' theorem; Condorcet's Jury Theorem; Supreme Court; panel size; reversing a verdict	CONDORCETS JURY THEOREM	We consider the problem of evaluating the reliability of a verdict given by a panel of judges. Given no information other than the number of panelists for and against, we address the question of when is a verdict that was obtained by a majority of k(1) vs. j(1) more or less reliable than one reached by k(2) vs j(2) We define criteria and investigate which verdicts are comparable and which are not. Consequences of this study may have bearing on choice of panel size and decision rule for decision-making bodies, such as courts, juries, committees, and boards. As implied by the above, our perspective is a posterior view of reliability though it also entails prior concern regarding how the reliability of a verdict will be perceived after being delivered. As an example, we apply our results to comparing the reliability of different verdicts handed down by the Supreme Court of the State of Israel and assessing the option of expanding a hearing on a case from a bench of three judges to a larger panel.

We use the so-called constant elasticity of variance (CEV) diffusion model where the volatility is a function of the underlying asset price. We derive analytical formulae for the prices of important types of path-dependent options under this assumption. We demonstrate that the prices of options, which depend on extrema, such as barrier and lookback options, can be much more sensitive to the specification of the underlying price process than standard call and put options and show that a financial institution that uses the standard geometric Brownian motion assumption is exposed to significant pricing and hedging errors when dealing in path-dependent options.

J	Corbett, CJ; Karmarkar, US				Corbett, CJ; Karmarkar, US			Competition and structure in serial supply chains with deterministic demand	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chains; competition; pricing; production; entry; fixed costs	VERTICAL INTEGRATION; ENTRY; CAPACITY; MARKETS	Supply chains often consist of several tiers, with different numbers of firms competing at each tier. A major determinant of the structure of supply chains is the cost structure associated with the underlying manufacturing process. In this paper, we examine the impact of fixed and variable costs on the structure and competitiveness of supply chains with a serial structure and price-sensitive linear deterministic demand. The entry stage is modeled as a simultaneous game, where the players take the outcomes of the subsequent post-entry (Cournot) competition into account in making their entry decisions. We derive expressions for prices and production quantities as functions of the number of entrants at each tier of a multitier chain. We characterize viability and stability of supply-chain structures and show, using lattice arguments, that there is always an equilibrium structure in pure strategies in the entry game. Finally, we examine the effects of vertical integration in the two-tier case. Altogether, the paper provides a framework for comparing a variety of supply-chain structures and for studying how they are affected by cost structures and by the number of entrants throughout the chain.

J	Burnetas, A; Gilbert, S				Burnetas, A; Gilbert, S			Future capacity procurements under unknown demand and increasing costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							INVENTORY MODELS; RETURNS POLICIES; MANAGEMENT; SALES	In this paper we study a situation in which a broker must manage the procurement of a short-life-cycle product. As the broker observes demand for the item, she learns about the demand process. However, as is often the case in practice, it becomes either more difficult or more expensive to procure the item as the selling season advances. Thus, the broker must trade off higher procurement costs against the benefit of making ordering decisions with better information about demand. Problems of this type arise, for example, in the travel industry, where a travel agent's cost of procuring airline and hotel reservations increases as the date of a vacation package approaches. We develop a newsvendor-like characterization of the optimal procurement policy. In a numerical analysis, we demonstrate how broker procurements tend to cluster just before price increases and how brokers can benefit from explicitly considering the effects of information about demand in their ordering policies.

After reviewing some of the basic preprocessing techniques for handling safety stocks and multilevel problems, we discuss a variety of aspects arising particularly in small and large bucket (time period) models such as start-ups, changeovers, minimum batch sizes, choice of one or two set-ups per period, etc. A set of applications is described that contains one or more of these special features, and some indicative computational results are presented. Finally, to show another technique that is useful, a slightly different (supply chain) application is presented, for which the a priori addition of some simple mixed-integer inequalities, based on aggregation, leads to important improvements in the results.

J	Fischetti, M; Salazar, JJ				Fischetti, M; Salazar, JJ			Solving the cell suppression problem on tabular data with linear constraints	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						statistical disclosure control; confidentiality; cell suppression; integer linear programming; tabular data; branch-and-cut algorithms	STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE CONTROL; MODELS	Cell suppression is a widely used technique for protecting sensitive information in statistical data presented in tabular form. Previous works on the subject mainly concentrate on 2- and 3-dimensional tables whose entries are subject to marginal totals. In this paper we address the problem of protecting sensitive data in a statistical table whose entries are linked by a generic system of linear constraints. This very general setting covers, among others, k-dimensional tables with marginals as well as the so-called hierarchical and linked tables that are very often used nowadays for disseminating statistical data. In particular, we address the optimization problem known in the literature as the (secondary) Cell Suppression Problem, in which the information loss due to suppression has to be minimized. We introduce a new integer linear programming model and outline an enumerative algorithm for its exact solution. The algorithm can also be used as a heuristic procedure to find near-optimal solutions. Extensive computational results on a test-bed of 1,160 real-world and randomly generated instances are presented, showing the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, we were able to solve to proven optimality 4-dimensional tables with marginals as well as linked tables of reasonable size (to our knowledge, tables of this kind were never solved optimally by previous authors).

J	Fuloria, PC; Zenios, SA				Fuloria, PC; Zenios, SA			Outcomes-adjusted reimbursement in a health-care delivery system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						health-care financing; fee for service; capitation; principal-agent models; dynamic incentives; end-stage renal disease	DIALYSIS	This paper considers a health-care delivery system with two noncooperative parties: a purchaser of medical services and a specialized provider. A dynamic principal-agent model that captures the interaction between the two parties is developed. In this model, patients arrive exogenously, receive periodic treatment from the provider, suffer costly complications that require hospital care, and eventually exit the system in death. The provider chooses the intensity of treatment in each period, incurs an associated cost, and is reimbursed by the purchaser according to observed patient outcomes. The purchaser's problem is to determine a payment system that will induce treatment choices maximizing total social welfare. The optimal payment system, referred to as the outcomes-adjusted payment system, is identified. It consists of a prospective payment per patient and a retrospective payment adjustment based on adverse short-term patient outcomes. This system induces the most efficient delivery of medical services by combining the immediate "threat" of a retrospective payment adjustment with the future reward of prospective payments generated by surviving patients. A numerical example is provided in the context of Medicare's End-Stage Renal Disease program. The example compares the optimal system to systems that are currently in place. The results suggest that the purchaser can achieve significant gains in patient life expectancy by switching to the outcomes-adjusted payment system, but this requires accurate information about treatment technology, patient characteristics, and provider preferences. The life-expectancy gains do not involve increased medical expenditures.

J	Pisano, GP; Bohmer, RMJ; Edmondson, AC				Pisano, GP; Bohmer, RMJ; Edmondson, AC			Organizational differences in rates of learning: Evidence from the adoption of minimally invasive cardiac surgery	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational learning; learning curves; process improvement	INNOVATION; CURVES; PERSISTENCE; TURNOVER; VOLUME	This paper examines learning curves in the health care setting to determine whether organizations achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates. Although extensive research has shown that cumulative experience leads to performance improvement across numerous contexts, the question of how much of this improvement is due to mere experience and how much is due to collective learning processes has received little attention. We argue that organizational learning processes may allow some organizations to benefit more than others from equivalent levels of experience. We thus propose that learning curves can vary across organizations engaged in the same "learning task," due to organizational learning effects. To investigate this proposition, we investigate cardiac surgery departments implementing a new technology for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Data on operative procedure times from a sample of 660 patients who underwent the new operation at 16 different institutions are analyzed. The results confirm that cumulative experience is a significant predictor of learning, and further reveal that the slope of the learning curve varies significantly across organizations. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.

J	Bonser, JS; Wu, SD				Bonser, JS; Wu, SD			Procurement planning to maintain both short-term adaptiveness and long-term perspective	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						planning under uncertainty; contracting; procurement; stochastic optimization		We study the fuel procurement problem for electrical utilities under uncertain demand and market price. Long-term contractual supply commitments are made at a set price with fuel suppliers at the beginning of each year. Each month the procurement planner can use fuel from these contracts or purchase fuel at the current market price. Motivated by practical insights from this market, we propose a two-phase dynamic procedure to determine a procurement plan. In the first phase, the minimum contract purchases for each month are determined at the beginning of the year. In the second phase, given the minimum contract purchases, the more detailed procurement decisions are determined at the beginning of each month with the most up-to-date information. We perform intensive computational experiments that show that this procedure produces high-quality solutions comparable to a rolling-horizon stochastic-programming heuristic, is easier to maintain and generalize, is computationally faster, and is robust to random fluctuations in demand requirements, spot market prices, and other sources of uncertainty.

J	Nault, BR; Tyagi, RK				Nault, BR; Tyagi, RK			Implementable mechanisms to coordinate horizontal alliances	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						economics of interaction; horizontal alliances; externalities; incentive mechanisms	ORGANIZATIONS; NETWORK; FORM	Unprecedented changes in the economics of interaction, mainly as a result of advances in information and telecommunication technologies such as the Internet, are causing a shift toward more networked forms of organizations such as horizontal alliances - that is, alliances among firms in similar businesses that have positive externalities between them. Because the success of such horizontal alliances depends crucially on aligning individual alliance-member incentives with those of the alliance as a whole, it is important to find coordination mechanisms that achieve this alignment and are simple-to-implement. In this paper, we examine two simple coordination mechanisms for a horizontal alliance characterized by the following features: (i) firms in the alliance can exert effort only in their "local" markets to increase customer demand for the alliance; (ii) customers are mobile and a customer living in a given alliance member's local area may have a need to buy from some other alliance member; and (iii) the coordination rules followed by the alliance determine which firms from a large pool of potential member-firms join the alliance, and how much effort each firm joining the alliance exerts in its local market. In this horizontal alliance setup, we consider the use of two coordination mechanisms: (i) a linear transfer of fees between members if demand from one member's local customer is served by another member, and (ii) ownership of an equal share of the alliance profits generated from a royalty on each member's sales. We derive conditions on the distribution of demand externalities among alliance members to determine when each coordination mechanism should be used separately, and when the mechanisms should be used together.

For example, our paper is motivated by the simulation of a large industrial project called a land seismic survey, in which project performance is based on duration, cost, and resource utilization. To address these types of problems, we develop a ranking and selection procedure for making comparisons of systems (e.g., project configurations) that have multiple performance measures. The procedure combines multiple attribute utility theory with statistical ranking and selection to select the best configuration from a set of possible configurations using the indifference-zone approach. We apply our procedure to results generated by the simulator for a land seismic survey that has six performance measures, and describe a particular type of sensitivity analysis that can be used as a robustness check.

J	Anderson, EG				Anderson, EG			The nonstationary staff-planning problem with business cycle and learning effects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						staff planning; learning; capacity planning; knowledge management; product development; system dynamics; control theory; stochastic dynamic programming		Managing highly skilled employees is extremely complex because of the need to balance the costs and time lags associated with their training against the need to meet demand as quickly as possible. Unlike previous approaches to this problem in the staffing literature, this paper develops an optimal staffing policy at the strategic level to cope with nonstationary stochastic demand for a staff characterized by unproductive apprentice employees and fully productive experienced employees. The paper then explores the implications of this policy in different industries, using empirical data. Aside from the optimal policy, this paper's primary results include: (1) demand volatility reduces average productivity, most especially under conditions of low (or slightly negative) growth and - nonintuitively - low employee turnover or knowledge obsolescence rates; (2) there is a trade-off between meeting demand and high productivity; (3) firms with longer business cycles should smooth their hiring and firing policies; and (4) firms in industries with longer training times should smooth their hiring and firing policies. The paper also explores the possible rewards from reducing training times and turnover rates. Finally, it discusses managerial implications and possible future directions in research.

J	Fischetti, M; Lodi, A; Martello, S; Toth, P				Fischetti, M; Lodi, A; Martello, S; Toth, P			A polyhedral approach to simplified crew scheduling and vehicle scheduling problems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						crew scheduling; vehicle scheduling; polyhedral methods	TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; TIME CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHM; BRANCH; FLOW	Crew and vehicle scheduling are fundamental issues in public transit management. Informally, they can be described as the problem of determining the optimal duties for a set of crews (e.g., bus drivers) or vehicles (e.g., buses) so as to cover a given set of timetabled trips, satisfying a number of constraints laid down by the union contract and company regulations. We consider the simplified but still NP-hard case in which several depots are specified, and limits on both the total time between the start and the end of any duty (spread time) and the total duty operational time (working time) are imposed. We give a 0-1 linear programming formulation based on binary variables associated with trip transitions, which applies to both crew and vehicle scheduling. The model is enhanced by means of new families of valid inequalities, for which exact and heuristic separation procedures are proposed. These techniques are embedded into an exact branch-and-cut algorithm, which also incorporates heuristic procedures. The performance of two implementations of the method (for vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling, respectively) are evaluated through computational testing on both random and real-world test problems from the literature.

J	Gopalakrishnan, M; Ding, K; Bourjolly, JM; Mohan, S				Gopalakrishnan, M; Ding, K; Bourjolly, JM; Mohan, S			A tabu-search heuristic for the capacitated lot-sizing problem with set-up carryover	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lot sizing; tabu search; set-up carryover	FRAMEWORK; TIMES	This paper presents a tabu-search heuristic for the capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP) with set-up carryover. This production-planning problems allows multiple items to be produced within a time period, and setups for items to be carried over from one period to the next. Two interrelated decisions, sequencing and lot sizing, are present in this problem. Our tabu-search heuristic consists of five basic move types - three for the sequencing decisions and two for the lot-sizing decisions. We allow infeasible solutions to be generated at a penalty during the course of the search. We use several search strategies, such as dynamic tabu list, adaptive memory, and self-adjusting penalties, to strengthen our heuristic. We also propose a lower-bounding procedure to estimate the quality of our heuristic solution. We have also modified our heuristic to produce good solutions for the CLSP without set-up carryover. The computational study, conducted on a set of 540 test problems, indicates that on average our heuristic solutions are within 12% of a bound on optimality. In addition, for the set of test problems our results indicate an 8% reduction in total cost through set-up carryover.

J	Vanderbeck, F				Vanderbeck, F			A nested decomposition approach to a three-stage, two-dimensional cutting-stock problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						cutting stock; trim loss; knapsack problems; integer programming; nested decomposition	COLUMN GENERATION; ALGORITHM	We consider the cutting of rectangular order pieces into stock pieces of specified width and length. The cutting process involves three stages of orthogonal guillotine cutting: Stock pieces are cut into sections that are cut into slits that are cut into order pieces. Restrictions imposed on the cutting process make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex, but limit the scope of solution space. The objective of the problem is mainly to minimize waste, but our model also accounts for other issues such as aging stock pieces, urgent or optional orders, and fixed setup costs. Our solution approach involves a nested decomposition of the problem and the recursive use of the column-generation technique: We use a column-generation formulation of the problem (Gilmore and Gomory 1965) and the cutting-pattern-generation subproblem is itself solved using a column-generation algorithm. LP-based lower bounds on the minimum cost are computed and, by rounding the LP solution, a feasible solution and associated upper bound is obtained. This approach could in principle be used in a branch-and-bound search to solve the problem to optimality. We report computational results for industrial instances. The algorithm is being used in industry as a production-planning tool.

J	Adner, R; Levinthal, D				Adner, R; Levinthal, D			Demand heterogeneity and technology evolution: Implications for product and process innovation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technology life cycle; price evolution; demand heterogeneity	DIFFUSION	The evolution of technology has been a central issue in the strategy and organizations Literature. However, the focus of much of this work has been on what is essentially the "supply side" of technical change-the evolution of firm capabilities. We present a demand-based view of technology evolution that is focused on the interaction between technology development and the demand environment in which the technology is ultimately evaluated. We develop a formal computer simulation model that explicitly considers the influence of heterogeneity in market demand-the presence of consumers with different needs and requirements-on firms' innovation choices. The model is used to examine the dynamics of product and process innovation (Utterback and Abernathy 1975). The analysis reveals that demand heterogeneity offers an alternative to supply-side explanations of the technology Life cycle. Further, by considering the implications of decreasing marginal utility from performance improvements, the model highlights the role of "technologically satisfied" consumers in shaping innovation incentives, and suggests a rationale for a new stage in the technology life cycle characterized by increasing performance at a stable price. The stage has not yet been treated formally in the Literature, but is widely observed, most prominently in digital and information-based technologies.

J	Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA				Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA			Contracting to assure supply: How to share demand forecasts in a supply chain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						game theory; coordination; signaling; asymmetric information	INFORMATION; FLEXIBILITY	Forecast sharing is studied in a supply chain with a manufacturer that faces stochastic demand for a single product and a supplier that is the sole source for a critical component. The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract,the supplier constructs-capacity (if he accepts the Contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime.

J	Seshadri, S; Shapira, Z				Seshadri, S; Shapira, Z			Managerial allocation of time and effort: The effects of interruptions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						attention; decision rules; priority setting; satisficing; thermostat; controlled Markov process	DECISION-MAKING; RISK	Time is one of the more salient constraints on managerial behavior. This constraint may be very taxing in high-velocity environments where managers have to attend to many;tasks simultaneously. Earlier work by Radner (1976) proposed models based on notions of the thermostat or "putting out fires" to guide managerial time and effort allocation among tasks. We link these ideas to the issue of the level of complexity of the tasks to be attended to while alluding to the sequential versus parallel modes of processing. We develop a stochastic model to analyze the behavior of a manager who has to attend to a few short-term proesses while attempting to devote as much time as possible to the pursuit of a long-term project. A major aspect of this problem is how the manager deals with interruptions. Different rules of attention allocation are proposed, and their implications to managerial behavior are discussed.

Parallel testing has the advantage of proceeding more rapidly than serial testing but does not take advantage of the potential for learning between tests, thus resulting in a larger number of tests. We model this trade-off in the form of a dynamic program and derive the optimal testing strategy (or mix of parallel and serial testing) that minimizes both the to;al cost and time of testing. We derive the optimal testing strategy as a function of testing cost, prior knowledge, and testing lead time. Using information theory to measure the test efficiency, we further show that in the case of imperfect testing (due to noise or simulated test conditions), the attractiveness of parallel strategies decreases. Finally, we analyze the relationship between testing strategies and the structure of design hierarchy. We show that a key benefit of modular product architecture lies in the reduction of testing cost.

J	Fisher, M; Ramdas, K; Zheng, YS				Fisher, M; Ramdas, K; Zheng, YS			Ending inventory valuation in multiperiod production scheduling	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						end effects; dynamic lot sizing; ending inventory valuation	LOT-SIZE MODEL; FORECAST HORIZONS; PLANNING-HORIZONS; ERROR-BOUNDS	When making lot-sizing decisions, managers often use a model horizon T that is much smaller than any reasonable estimate of the firm's future horizon. This is done because forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly for longer horizons, while computational burden increases. However, what is optimal over the short horizon may be suboptimal over the long run, resulting in errors known as end-effects. A common end-effect in lot-sizing models is to set end-of-horizon inventory to zero. This policy can result in excessive setup costs or stock-outs in the long run. We present a method to mitigate end-effects in lot sizing by including a valuation term V(I-T) for end-of-horizon inventory I-T, in the objective function of the short-horizon model. We develop this concept within the classical EOQ modeling framework, and then apply it to the dynamic lot-sizing problem (DLSP). If demand in each period of the DLSP equals the long-run average demand rate, then our procedure induces an optimal ordering policy over the short horizon that coincides with the long-run optimal ordering policy. We test our procedure empirically against the Wagner-Whitin algorithm and the Silver Meal heuristic, under several demand patterns, within a rolling horizon framework. With few exceptions, our approach significantly outperforms the other approaches tested, for modest to long model horizons. We discuss applicability to more general lot-sizing problems.

J	Chen, FR; Federgruen, A; Zheng, YS				Chen, FR; Federgruen, A; Zheng, YS			Coordination mechanisms for a distribution system with one supplier and multiple retailers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						coordination; pricing; quantity discounts; supply chain management	DISCOUNT PRICING MODEL; QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; CHANNEL; PROFITS; VENDOR	We address a fundamental two-echelon distribution system in which the sales volumes of the retailers are endogenously determined on the basis of known demand functions. Specifically, this paper studies a distribution channel where a supplier distributes a single product to retailers, who in turn sell the product to consumers. The demand in each retail market arrives continuously at a constant rate that is a general decreasing function of the retail price in the market. We have characterized an optimal strategy, maximizing total systemwide profits in a centralized system. We have also shown that the same optimum level of channelwide profits can be achieved-in a decentralized system, but only if coordination is achieved via periodically charged, fixed fees, and a nontraditional discount pricing scheme under which the discount given to a retailer is the sum of three discount components based on the retailer's (i) annual-sales volume, (ii) order quantity, and (iii) order frequency, respectively. Moreover, we show that no (traditional) discount scheme, based on order quantities only, suffices to optimize channelwide profits when there-are multiple nonidentical retailers. The paper also considers a scenario where the channel members fail to coordinate their decisions and provides numerical examples that illustrate the value of coordination. We extend our results to settings in which the retailers' holding cost rates depend on the wholesale price.

J	Lim, WS				Lim, WS			Producer-supplier contracts with incomplete information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						contract design; quality control; game theory; incomplete information	COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT; DELIVERY; QUALITY	This paper investigates the contract design problem of a producer when he purchases parts from a supplier, and there is incomplete information regarding the quality of the parts. This is the first game-theoretic model of quality control tl;at captures this informational asymmetry. We focus on two compensation schemes embedded in the contract, namely, price rebate (when inspection is done upon receipt of the parts) and warranty. We show that when a full-price rebate is not possible and the producer and the supplier have to share the damage costs, an optimal contract is such that the:supplier compensates the producer by the same amount, regardless of his quality type. However, a supplier with low quality is more likely to be offered a contract with an inspection scheme, while a supplier with high quality is constrained with a warranty scheme. We also show that when the producer need not share the cost in exactly one of the compensation schemes, he may still offer the other compensation scheme to a supplier type depending on the relative costs involved, the maximum compensation cost acceptable by all supplier types, and his ex ante beliefs about the quality level of the supplier.

J	Langer, T; Weber, M				Langer, T; Weber, M			Prospect theory, mental accounting, and differences in aggregated and segregated evaluation of lottery portfolios	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						prospect theory; mental accounting; evaluation procedures	RISK-TAKING; REPEATED GAMBLES; EQUITY PREMIUM; LOSS AVERSION; CHOICES; PUZZLE; MYOPIA	If individuals have to evaluate a sequence of lotteries, their judgment is influenced by the presentation mode. Experimental studies have found significantly higher acceptance rates for a sequence of lotteries if the overall distribution was displayed instead of the set of lotteries itself. Mental accounting and loss aversion provide an easy and intuitive explanation for this phenomenon. Ln this paper we offer an explanation that incorporates further evaluation concepts of Prospect Theory. Our formal analysis of the difference in aggregated and segregated portfolio evaluation demonstrates that the higher attractiveness of the aggregated presentation mode is not a general phenomenon (as suggested in the Literature) but depends on specific parameters of the lotteries. The theoretical findings are supported by an experimental study In contrast to the existing evidence and in line with our theoretical results, we find for specific types of lotteries an even lower acceptance rate if the overall distribution is displayed.

J	Sobrero, M; Roberts, EB				Sobrero, M; Roberts, EB			The trade-off between efficiency and learning in interorganizational relationships for product development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; innovation; interorganizational relationships; efficiency; learning	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PROJECT PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; INFORMATION; COSTS; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES	his paper analyzes the performance implications of interorganizational relationships in the development of technological innovations, focusing on the characteristics of the tasks partitioned between a manufacturer and its suppliers in the development of new products. We identify two critical dimensions: (1) the design scope and (2) the level of task interdependency. The design scope dimension characterizes the type of problem-solving activities outsourced by the manufacturer. The level of task interdependency dimension characterizes the influence of any given supplier-manufacturer interaction on other activities within an overall innovation process. Data:analyses on 50 supplier-manufacturer relationships drawn from three new product development projects show that the type of problem-solving activities being partitioned and their level of interdependency with the rest of the project are important predictors of performance outcomes of the relationship, controlling for contractual differences. Further, the analyses demonstrate a clear trade-off between short-term efficiency-increasing and longer-term learning-enhancing outcomes.

The items are produced in two stages, each with its own lead-time; in the first stage a common intermediate product is manufactured. The production volumes in the first stage are bounded by given capacity limits. We develop an accurate lower bound and close-to-optimal heuristic strategies of simple structure. The gap between them, evaluated in an extensive numerical study, is on average only 0.45%. We use the model to investigate the benefits of various delayed product differentiation (postponement) strategies, as well as other strategic questions, including (i) the benefits of flexible versus dedicated production facilities; (ii) the trade-off between capacity and inventory investments, and (iii) the trade-off between capacity investments and service levels.

J	Heiman, A; McWilliams, B; Shen, ZH; Zilberman, D				Heiman, A; McWilliams, B; Shen, ZH; Zilberman, D			Learning and forgetting: Modeling optimal product sampling over time	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						diffusion; learning; product sampling; goodwill; forgetting; experimenting	TRIAL	Firms use samples to increase the sales of almost all consumable goods, including food, health, and cleaning products. Despite its importance, sampling remains one of the most under-researched areas. There are no theoretical quantitative models of sampling behavior other than the pioneering work of Jain et al. (1995), who modeled sampling as an important factor in the diffusion of new products. In this paper we characterize sampling as having two effects. The first is the change in the probability of a consumer purchasing a product immediately after having sampled the product. The second is an increase in the consumer's cumulative goodwill formation, which results from sampling the product. This distinction differentiates our model from other models of goodwill, in which firm sales are only a function of the existing goodwill level. We determine the optimal dynamic sampling effort of a firm and examine the factors that affect the sampling decision. We find that although the sampling effort will decline over a product's Life cycle, it may continue in mature products. Another finding is that when we have a positive change in the factors that increase sampling productivity steady-state goodwill stock and sales will increase, but equilibrium sampling can either increase or decrease. The change in the sampling level is indeterminate because, while increased sampling productivity means that firms have incentives to increase sampling, the increase in the equilibrium goodwill level indirectly reduces the marginal productivity of sampling, thus reducing the incentives to sample. We discuss managerial implications, and how the model can be used to address various circumstances.

J	Juneja, S; Shahabuddin, P				Juneja, S; Shahabuddin, P			Fast simulation of Markov chains with small transition probabilities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; Markov chains; reliability models; steady-state measures; importance-sampling	EXCESSIVE BACKLOGS; MONTE-CARLO; SYSTEMS; NETWORKS; MODELS	Consider: a-finite-state Markov chain where the transition probabilities differ by orders of magnitude. This Markov chain has an "attractor state," i.e., from any state of the Markov chain there exists:a sample path of significant probability-to the-attractor state. There also exists a "rare set," which is accessible from the attractor state only by sample paths of very. small probability. The problem is to estimate the probability that starting from the attractor state, the Maykov-chain hits the rare set before returning to the attractor state. Examples of this setting arise in the case of reliability models with highly reliable components as well as in the case of-queueing networks with low traffic. Importance-sampling is a commonly used simulation technique for the fast estimation of rare-event probabilities. It-involves simulating the Markov chain under a new probability-measure that emphasizes the most likely paths to therare set.-Previous research focused on developing importance-sampling schemes fora special case of Markov chains that did not include "high-probability cycles." We show, through examples that the Markov chains,used to model many commonly encountered systems do have high-probability cycles, and existing importance-sampling schemes can lead to infinite variance in simulating such systems, We then develop the insight that in the:presence. of high-probability cycles care should be taken in allocating:the new transition probabilities so that the variance accumulated over these cycles does not increase without bounds. Based on this observation we develop two importance-sampling techniques that have the bounded; relative error property, i.e., the simulation run-length required to estimate the, rare-event probability to a fixed degree of accuracy remains bounded the event of interest becomes more rare.

We find-greater support for quality-based learning models that assume learning is a function of both proactive investments in quality improvement and autonomous learning-by-doing, than for models-that assume learning is a function of reactive investments in quality improvement alone. We then extend these two:Sets of models: to examine the impact of individual prevention activities and past nonconformance expenditures on defect rates. We find that-benefits from different types of prevention expenditures vary, and that past nonconformance expenditures provide learning opportunities that allow the organization to more efficiently cope with future failures,, thereby reducing subsequent nonconformance costs. These important implications are absent incurrent-quality-based learning models, providing an opportunity for future theoretical development.

We investigate these benefits in the context of a supply chain in which a manufacturer supplies;expensive, low-demand items to vertically integrated or autonomous retailers via one central depot. The manufacturer's lead time is assumed to be due to the geographical distance, from the market or a combination of low:volumes, high variety,land inflexible production processes. We formulate and solve an appropriate mathematical model based on one-for-one inventory policies in which a replenishment order is placed as soon as the customer withdraws an item. We find that sharing and transshipment of items often, but not always, reduces the overall costs of holding, shipping, and waiting for inventory. Unexpectedly, these cost reductions are sometimes achieved through increasing overall inventory levels in the supply chain. Finally while sharing of inventory typically: benefits all the participants in decentralized supply chains, this is not necessarily the case-sharing can hurt the distributor or individual retailers, regardless of their relative power: in the supply chain.

J	Raghunathan, S				Raghunathan, S			Information sharing in a supply chain: A note on its value when demand is nonstationary	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; information sharing; electronic data interchange		In a recent paper, Lee, So, and Tang (2000) showed that in a two-level supply chain with non-stationary AR(1) end demand, the manufacturer benefits significantly when the retailer shares point-of-sale (POS) demand data. We show in this paper, analytically and through simulation, that the manufacturer's benefit is insignificant when the parameters of the AR(1) process are known to both parties, as in Lee, So, and Tang (LST). The key-reason for the difference:between our results and those of LST is that:LST assume that the manufacturer also uses an AR(1) process to forecast the retailer order quantity. However, the manufacturer can reduce the variance-of its forecast further by using the entire order history to which it has access. Thus, when intelligent use of already available internal information (order history) suffices, there is no need to invest in interorganizational systems for information sharing.

This paper attempts to demonstrate that firms are selected for survival on the basis of contracting efficiency. Based on a statistical analysis of 170 new franchise contracts and interviews with the founders of 16 of these new franchise systems, we show that new franchise chains that adopt exclusive territories are more Likely to survive over time than chains that do not. Moreover, successful and failed entrepreneurs possess different information about how to design contracts.

J	Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR				Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR			The long-run stock price performance of firms with effective TQM programs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						total quality management; quality awards; stock price performance; shareholder value	QUALITY AWARDS; MARKET VALUE; RETURNS; STRATEGY	This paper documents the long-run stock price performance of firms with effective Total Quality Management (TQM) programs. The winning of quality awards is used as a proxy for effective TQM implementation. We compare stock price performance of award winners against various matched control groups for a five-year implementation period and a five-year postimplementation period. During the implementation period there is no difference in the stock price performance, but during the postimplementation period award winners significantly outperform firms in the various control groups. Depending on the control group used, the mean outperformance ranges from 38% to 46%. Our results clearly indicate that effective implementation of TQM principles and philosophies leads to significant wealth creation. Furthermore, our results should alleviate many of the concerns regarding the value of quality award systems. Overall, these systems are valuable in terms of recognizing TQM firms and promoting awareness of TQM.

J	Kaplan, EH; Garstka, S				Kaplan, EH; Garstka, S			March Madness and the office pool	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						March Madness; office pools; probability modeling; statistical estimation; Markov models; dynamic programming	TOURNAMENTS	March brings March Madness, the annual conclusion to the U.S. men's college basketball season with two single elimination basketball tournaments showcasing the best college teams in the country. Almost as mad is the plethora of office pools across the country where the object is to pick a priori as many game winners as possible in the tournament. More generally, the object in an office pool is to maximize total pool points, where different points are awarded for different correct winning predictions. We consider the structure of single elimination tournaments, and show how to efficiently calculate the mean and the variance of the number of correctly predicted wins (or more generally the total points earned in an office pool) for a given slate of predicted winners. We apply these results to both random and Markov tournaments. We then show how to determine optimal office pool predictions that maximize the expected number of points earned in the pool. Considering various Markov probability models for predicting game winners based on regular season performance, professional sports rankings, and Las Vegas betting odds, we compare our predictions with what actually happened in past NCAA and NIT tournaments. These models perform similarly, achieving overall prediction accuracies of about 58%, but do not surpass the simple strategy of picking the seeds when the goal is to pick as many game winners as possible. For a more sophisticated point structure, however, our models do outperform the strategy of picking the seeds.

The algorithm is founded upon the computational simplicity of the tridiagonal structure of the inverse of the Brownian correlation matrix. Compared with existing pricing technologies without the "barrier too close" problem, our calculation method can produce a more accurate and efficient analytic evaluation of barrier options monitored at discrete instants with well- or ill-behaved barrier levels, or discrete hindsight options, for a reasonably large number of monitorings.

J	Shenhar, AJ				Shenhar, AJ			One size does not fit all projects: Exploring classical contingency domains	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						project management; contingency theory; project types; project classification; technological uncertainty; system complexity	PRODUCT INNOVATION; ELECTRONICS FIRMS; SUCCESS; FAILURE; ENVIRONMENTS; ORGANIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; ADOPTION	Not many authors have attempted to classify projects according to any specific scheme, and those who have tried rarely offered extensive empirical evidence. From a theoretical perspective, a traditional distinction between radical and incremental innovation has often been used in the Literature of innovation, and has created the basis for many classical contingency studies. Similar concepts, however, did not become standard in the literature of projects, and it seems that theory development in project management is still in its early years. As a result, most project management literature still assumes that all projects are fundamentally similar and that "one size fits all." The purpose of this exploratory research is to show how different types of projects are managed in different ways, and to explore the domain of traditional contingency theory in the more modern world of projects. This two-step research is using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and two data sets to suggest a conceptual, two-dimensional construct model for the classification of technical projects and for the investigation of project contingencies. Within this framework, projects are classified into four levels of technological uncertainty, and into three levels of system complexity, according to a hierarchy of systems and subsystems. The study provides two types of implications, For project leadership it shows why and how management should adapt a more project-specific style. For theory development, it offers a collection of insights that seem relevant to the world of projects as temporary organizations, but are, at times, different, from classical structural contingency theory paradigms in enduring organizations. While still exploratory in nature, this study attempts to suggest new inroads to the future study of modern project domains.

J	Tagaras, G; Vlachos, D				Tagaras, G; Vlachos, D			A periodic review inventory system with emergency replenishments	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; periodic review; emergency ordering	2 SUPPLY MODES; ORDERS	This paper proposes and analyzes a periodic review inventory system with two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed periodically following a base stock policy on inventory position, and arrive at the stocking location after a deterministic lead time. The location also has the option of placing emergency orders, characterized by a shorter lead time but higher acquisition cost, in case of imminent stockouts. Thus, at some appropriate time in the replenishment cycle, the necessity and size of an emergency order is determined according to a base stock policy on net stock. The timing of the emergency order is such that this order arrives and can be used to satisfy the demand in the time period just before the arrival of a regular order, when the likelihood of a stockout is highest. An approximate cost model is developed which can easily be optimized with respect to the order-up-to parameters. This model is used as the basis for a heuristic algorithm, which leads to solutions that are very close to the exact optimal solutions determined through simulation. It is shown that the proposed system offers substantial cost savings relative to a system without the emergency replenishment option.

J	Knott, AM				Knott, AM			The dynamic value of hierarchy	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						routines; franchise; managerial value	ORGANIZATIONS; PRODUCTIVITY	This study develops a dual-routines view of the dynamic value of hierarchy, and tests it against the implicit null hypothesis that hierarchy merely provides static advantages over markets. The view holds that hierarchical managers perform two roles that create value for firms in perpetuity-an administrative role of enforcing operational routine, and an entrepreneurial role of executing a metaroutine that continually revises operational routine to keep pace with changes in the environment. The test consists of a natural experiment comparing the behavior and performance of establishments that leave a franchise, "lose their hierarchical managers," with those that remain. I find support for the view. in the absence of the franchisor, establishment behavior drifts from the operational routine, and establishments fail to adopt innovation. Both responses lead to significant decay in performance. Thus hierarchical managers are necessary to actively enforce routine, even after the routine been assimilated, and to introduce innovation, even in this unique setting of perfect incentives.

J	Nelson, BL; Goldsman, D				Nelson, BL; Goldsman, D			Comparisons with a standard in simulation experiments	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; multiple comparisons; ranking and selection; output analysis	COMMON RANDOM NUMBERS; MULTIPLE COMPARISONS; SELECTION	We consider the problem of comparing a finite number of stochastic systems with respect to a single system (designated as the "standard") via simulation experiments. The comparison is based on expected performance, and the goal is to determine if any system has larger expected performance than the standard, and if so to identify the best of the alternatives. In this paper we provide two-stage experiment design and analysis procedures to solve the problem for a variety of scenarios, including those in which we encounter unequal variances across systems, as well as those in which we use the variance reduction technique of common random numbers and it is appropriate to do so. The emphasis is added because in some cases common random numbers can be counterproductive when performing comparisons with a standard. We also provide methods for estimating the critical constants required by our procedures, present a portion of an extensive empirical study, and demonstrate one of the procedures via a numerical example.

J	Downs, B; Metters, R; Semple, J				Downs, B; Metters, R; Semple, J			Managing inventory with multiple products, lags in delivery, resource constraints, and lost sales: A mathematical programming approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; heuristic approximation; nonparametric estimation; separable convex programming; linear programming	DEMAND; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; POLICY; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS	This paper develops an order-up-to S inventory model that is designed to handle multiple items, resource constraints, lags in delivery, and lost sales without sacrificing computational simplicity. Mild conditions are shown to ensure that the expected average holding cost and the expected average shortage cost are separable convex functions of the order-up-to levels. We develop nonparametric estimates of these costs and use them in conjunction with Linear programming to produce what is termed the "LP policy." The LP policy has two major advantages over traditional methods: first, it can be computed in complex environments such as the one described above; and second, it does not require an explicit functional form of demand, something that is difficult to specify accurately in practice. In two numerical experiments designed so that optimal policies could be computed, the LP policy fared well, differing from the optimal profit by an average of 2.20% and 1.84%, respectively. These results compare quite favorably with the errors incurred in traditional methods when a correctly specified distribution uses estimated parameters. Our findings support the effectiveness of this mathematical programming technique for approximating complex, real-world inventory control problems.

Such lines have become core components of modern repetitive manufacturing, and just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing in particular. One problem is to keep the usage rate of all parts fed into the final assembly as constant as possible (the "level-scheduling problem"), while the other is to keep the Line's workstation loads as constant as possible (the "car-sequencing problem"). In this paper the combined problem is formulated as a single-integer programming model. The LP-relaxation of this model is solved by column-generation techniques. The results of an experimental evaluation show that the lower bounds are tight.

J	Besanko, D; Dranove, D; Shanley, M				Besanko, D; Dranove, D; Shanley, M			Exploiting a cost advantage and coping with a cost disadvantage	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						competitive strategy; competitive advantage; pricing; cost pass-through	MARKET	This paper provides an empirical investigation of how firms with cost advantages (cost disadvantages) exploit (cope with) their advantages (disadvantages) through their pricing behavior. Guided by microeconomic theory and insights from the industrial organization literature, we develop testable implications about the effect of industry structure and firmspecific characteristics on the pass-through elasticity: The rate at which changes in a firm's cost relative to competitors translates into changes in the firm's price relative to competitors. We test these implications using data from the PIMS Competitive Strategy database. The results indicate that a firm's pass-through elasticity systematically depends on whether the firm operates in a commodity or noncommodity industry, the firm's capacity utilization, and its cost and quality position in its industry. The pass-through elasticity is also shown to depend in a nonlinear way on market concentration.

J	Eisenberg, L; Noe, TH				Eisenberg, L; Noe, TH			Systemic risk in financial systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						credit risk; default; clearing systems		We consider default by firms that are part of a single clearing mechanism. The obligations of all firms within the system are determined simultaneously in a fashion consistent with the priority of debt claims and the limited liability of equity We first show, via a fixed-point argument, that there always exists a "clearing payment vector" that clears the obligations of the members of the clearing system; under mild regularity conditions, this clearing vector is unique. Next, we develop an algorithm that both clears the financial system in a computationally efficient fashion and provides information on the systemic risk faced by the individual system firms. Finally, we produce qualitative comparative statics for financial systems. These comparative statics imply that, in contrast to single-firm results, even unsystematic, nondissipative shocks to the system will lower the total value of the system and may lower the value of the equity of some of the individual system firms.

J	Chen, CL				Chen, CL			Design for the environment: A quality-based model for green product development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; green marketing; natural environment	MARKET	Green product development, which addresses environmental issues through product design and innovation as opposed to the traditional end-of-pipe-control approach, is receiving significant attention from customers, industries, and governments around the world. in this paper we develop a quality-based model for analyzing the strategic and policy issues concerning the development of products with conflicting traditional and environmental attributes. On the demand side of the problem, we use the framework of conjoint analysis to structure the preferences of the ordinary and green customers. On the supply side, we apply the theories in optimal product design and market segmentation to analyze the producer's strategic decisions regarding the number of products introduced and their prices and qualities. On the policy side, we evaluate the effects of environmental standards on the economic and environmental consequences of green product development. By jointly considering the interactions among the customers' preferences, the producer's product strategies, and the environmental standards imposed by governments, we present some interesting findings that can be used to manage and regulate the development of green products. Two major findings show that green product development and stricter environmental standards might not necessarily benefit the environment.

J	Keskinocak, P; Ravi, R; Tayur, S				Keskinocak, P; Ravi, R; Tayur, S			Scheduling and reliable lead-time quotation for orders with availability intervals and lead-time sensitive revenues	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lead-time quotation; online algorithms; competitive ratio; complexity; scheduling	DUE-DATES; JOB-SHOP; SINGLE-MACHINE; RULES; ASSIGNMENT	Motivated by applications in the manufacturing and service industries, we consider two models for coordinating scheduling with lead-time quotation: a basic model. with a single customer type, and an enhanced model where an additional second customer type expects immediate service or production. In both models, revenues Obtained from the customers are sensitive to the lead time, there is a threshold of lead time above which the customer does not place an order, and the quoted lead times are 100% reliable. These models are related to well-known scheduling problems, which have been studied in both offline and online settings. We introduce the immediate quotation case and study it with the (traditional) online version. We provide complexity results for the offline case, and perform competitive analysis for the online cases. A natural question of bridging the gap between the online and quotation models leads us to the delayed quotation model, which we study briefly. The analysis of these models provides useful qualitative insights as well.

J	Christensen, PO; Feltham, GA				Christensen, PO; Feltham, GA			Efficient timing of communication in multiperiod agencies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						communication in agencies; multiperiod agency problems; principal/agent problem; long-term contracts	LONG-TERM-CONTRACTS; MORAL HAZARD; INFORMATION	This paper examines communication in a two-period principal/agent model in which the agent receives a private signal about the second outcome before the first outcome is realized. No communication is compared with communication at three possible dates: before the first outcome (early), at the first outcome/consumption date (normal), and between the initial consumption date and the second outcome (delayed). Delayed communication is shown to have no value if the agent's information is perfect, but can have value if it is imperfect. Early and normal communication can be used to "smooth" compensation across periods and, hence, generally have incremental value over delayed communication if the agent cannot borrow or save. However, the "smoothing" benefits disappear if he can borrow and save. Early and normal communication are equivalent if the agent has domain-additive exponential preferences and the private signal is uninformative about the first outcome. If the private signal is informative about the first outcome, the incremental value of early compared with normal communication attains its maximum for "medium" informativeness.

J	Hoyland, K; Wallace, SW				Hoyland, K; Wallace, SW			Generating scenario trees for multistage decision problems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						scenario generation; asset allocation; nonconvex programming	FINANCIAL-PLANNING MODEL; APPROXIMATIONS; PROGRAMS	In models of decision making under uncertainty we often are faced with the problem of representing the uncertainties in a form suitable for quantitative models. If the uncertainties are expressed in terms of multivariate continuous distributions, or a discrete distribution with far too many outcomes, we normally face two possibilities: either creating a decision model with internal sampling, or trying to find a simple discrete approximation of the given distribution that serves as input to the model. This paper presents a method based on nonlinear programming that can be used to generate a limited number of discrete outcomes that satisfy specified statistical properties. Users are free to specify any statistical properties they find relevant, and the method can handle inconsistencies in the specifications. The basic idea is to minimize some measure of distance between the statistical properties of the generated outcomes and the specified properties. We illustrate the method by single- and multiple-period problems. The results are encouraging in that a limited number of generated outcomes indeed have statistical properties that are close to or equal to the specifications. We discuss how to verify that the relevant statistical properties are captured in these specifications, and argue that what are the relevant properties, will be problem dependent.

J	Thomke, S; Bell, DE				Thomke, S; Bell, DE			Sequential testing in product development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						testing; experimentation; information; problem solving; prototyping; design; product development	DESIGN	A fundamental problem in managing product development is the optimal timing, frequency, and fidelity of sequential testing activities that are carried out to evaluate novel product concerts and designs. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that treats testing as an activity that generates information about technical and customer-need related problems An analysis of the model results in several important findings. First, optimal testing strategies need to balance the tension between several variables, including the increasing cost of redesign, the cost of a test as function of fidelity and the correlation between sequential tests. Second, a Simple form of our model results in an EOQ-like result: The optimal number of tests (called the Economic Testing Frequency or ETF) is the square root of the ratio of avoidable cost and the cost of a test. Third, the relationship between sequential tests can have an impact on optimal testing strategies. If sequential tests are increasing refinements of one another, managers should invest their budgets in a few high-fidelity tests, whereas if the tests identify problems independently of one another it may be more effective if developers carry out a higher number of lower-fidelity tests. Using examples, the implications for managerial practice are discussed and suggestions for further research undertakings are provided.

J	Ramdas, K; Sawhney, MS				Ramdas, K; Sawhney, MS			A cross-functional approach to evaluating multiple line extensions for assembled products	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product variety; component variety; profit maximization; cost interactions; revenue interactions	HIGH-VARIETY STRATEGIES; DESIGN; HEURISTICS; COMPONENT; SELECTION; DECISION	Assembled product manufacturers often introduce line extensions that share components with existing products, or among themselves, resulting in cost interactions among products because of shared costs, and revenue interactions because of cannibalization. We present a cross-functional approach to evaluating multiple line extensions that simultaneously considers revenue implications of component sharing at the product level and cost implications at the component level. We develop a source-of-volume model and a measurement procedure to decompose the life-cycle sales volume from a line extension into sales from cannibalization, competitive draw, and demand expansion. We develop an activity-based costing procedure for estimating the life-cycle costs of line extensions that share components. We develop an optimization model that uses these revenue and cost estimates to identify a subset of line extensions that maximizes incremental profits. We implement our approach at a quartz wristwatch manufacturer. Results suggest that our approach would have improved profits for the firm by over 5%, while actually launching fewer line extensions. We also find that the drivers of cannibalization are counterintuitive. In simulation studies, our approach outperforms three managerial heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach is most valuable when cannibalization dominates competitive draw as a source of volume, and discuss its relative merits under low and high parts-sharing.

J	Desai, P; Kekre, S; Radhakrishnan, S; Srinivasan, K				Desai, P; Kekre, S; Radhakrishnan, S; Srinivasan, K			Product differentiation and commonality in design: Balancing revenue and cost drivers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						design; product design; commonality; marketing; segmentation; marketing/manufacturing interface	QUALITY	Product design decisions substantially affect the cost and revenue drivers. A design configuration with commonality can lower manufacturing cost. However, such a design may hinder the ability to extract price premiums through product differentiation. We explicitly investigate the marketing-manufacturing trade-off and derive analytical implications for three possible design configurations: unique, premium-common, and basic-common. Our model considers two distinct segments of consumers. Some of the implications of our analysis are not readily apparent. For example, when the high-quality component is made common, the average quality of the products offered to the two segments increases. One may infer that with higher average quality, higher prices or higher total revenues might ensue. However, this may not be the case, as detailed in the paper. Finally, our analysis provides a useful framework to develop an index that can rank order components in terms of their attractiveness for commonality.

J	Krishnan, V; Gupta, S				Krishnan, V; Gupta, S			Appropriateness and impact of platform-based product development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; modular platforms; component commonality; design reuse	COMPONENT; FAMILY; LINE	In their quest to manage the complexity of offering greater product variety, firms in many industries are considering platform-based product development. Product platforms, which are component and subsystem assets shared across a product-family, enable a firm to better leverage investments in product design and development. While the platform approach offers a number of benefits, it also imposes certain additional costs that have not received adequate research attention. In this paper, we use an industrial example both to illustrate some of the costs and benefits of platform-based product development and to motivate the development of a mathematical model. The model is formulated to better understand the appropriateness of product platforms and their impact on product-planning decisions. Our results indicate that platforms are not appropriate for extreme levels of market diversity or high levels of nonplatform scale economies. Also, a firm's product positioning and introduction sequence decisions made during the product-planning phase are significantly impacted by the presence of platforms. Specifically, a platform increases the separation among products and offers a multitude of product introduction strategies. We translate our model findings into a managerial framework.

J	Goldenberg, J; Lehmann, DR; Mazursky, D				Goldenberg, J; Lehmann, DR; Mazursky, D			The idea itself and the circumstances of its emergence as predictors of new product success.	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new products; success; failure creativity; templates	INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTS; FAILURE; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; DETERMINANTS; DIMENSIONS; TEMPLATES; PROJECT; WINNERS	In view of the distressingly low rate of success in new product introduction, it is important to identify predictive guidelines early in:the new product development process so that better choices can be made and unnecessary costs avoided. In this paper, we propose a framework for early analysis based on the success potential embodied in the product-idea itself and the circumstances of its emergence. Based on two studies reporting actual introductions, we identified several determinants (such as how the ideas originated, their specific configurations, and the level of technology required for their implementation) that significantly distinguish successful from unsuccessful new products in the marketplace. We suggest that these factors, together with already known factors of success/failure, may aid in the estimation of the potential of a concept early in its development.

J	Huchzermeier, A; Loch, CH				Huchzermeier, A; Loch, CH			Project management under risk: Using the real options approach to evaluate flexibility in R&D	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						real options; R&D projects; project evaluation; decision trees; stochastic dynamic programming; managerial flexibility; project management	PRODUCT DEFINITION; INNOVATION	Managerial flexibility has value in the context of uncertain R&D projects, as management can repeatedly gather information about uncertain project and market characteristics and, based on this information, change its course of action. This value is now well accepted and referred to as "real option value." We introduce, in addition to the familiar real option of abandonment, the option of corrective action that management can take during the project. The intuition from options pricing theory is that higher uncertainty in project pay offs increases the real option value of managerial decision flexibility. However, R&D managers face uncertainty not only in payoffs, but also from many other sources. We identify five example types of R&D uncertainty, in market payoffs, project budgets, product performance, market requirements, and project schedules. How do they influence the value from managerial flexibility? We find that if uncertainty is resolved or costs/revenues occur after all decisions have been made, more variability may "smear out" contingencies and thus reduce the value of flexibility In addition, variability may reduce the probability of flexibility ever being exercised, which also reduces its value. This result runs counter to established option pricing theory intuition and contributes to a better risk management in R&D projects. Our model builds intuition for R&D managers as to when it is and when it is not worthwhile to delay commitments-for example, by postponing a design freeze, thus maintaining flexibility in R&D projects.

When allocating resources, developers must balance the cost of testing multiple designs against the potential profits that may result. We propose extreme-value theory as a mathematical abstraction of the concept-testing process. We investigate the trade-off between the benefits and costs of parallel concept testing and derive closed-form solutions for the case of profits that follow extreme-value distributions. We analyze the roles of the scale and tail-shape parameters of the profit distribution as well as the cost of testing in determining the optimal number of tests and total budget for the concept phase of NPD. Using an example, we illustrate how to estimate and interpret the scale and tail-shape parameters. We find that the impact of declining concept-testing costs on expected profits, the number of concepts tested, and total spending depend on the scale/cost ratio and tail-shape parameter of the profit distribution.

J	Fleming, L				Fleming, L			Recombinant uncertainty in technological search	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						invention; search; recombination; negative binomial dispersion model	COUNT DATA; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; FIRM; DISCONTINUITIES; PATENTS	While the Course of technological change is widely accepted to be highly uncertain and unpredictable, little work has identified or studied the ultimate sources and causes of that uncertainty. This paper proposes that purely technological uncertainty derives from inventors' search processes with unfamiliar components and component combinations. Experimentation with new components and new combinations leads to Less useful inventions on average, but it also implies an increase in the variability that can result in both failure and breakthrough. Negative binomial count and dispersion models with patent citation data demonstrate that new combinations are indeed more variable. Ln contrast to predictions, however, the reuse of components has a nonmonotonic and eventually positive effect on variability.

Between successive product generations, significant evolutions can occur in both the customer needs a product must address and the technologies it employs to satisfy these needs. Even within a single development project, firms must respond to new information, or risk developing a product that is obsolete the day it is launched. This paper examines the characteristics of an effective development process in one such environment-the Internet software industry. Using data on 29 completed development projects we show that in this industry, constructs that support a more flexible development process are associated with better-performing projects. This flexible process is characterized by the ability to generate and respond to new information for a longer proportion of a development cycle. The constructs that support such a process are greater investments in architectural design, earlier feedback on product performance from the market, and the use of a development team with greater amounts of "generational" experience. Our results suggest that investments in architectural design play a dual role in a flexible process: First through the need to select an architecture that maximizes product performance and, second, through the need to select an architecture that facilitates development process flexibility. We provide examples from our fieldwork to support this view.

J	Tatikonda, MV; Montoya-Weiss, MM				Tatikonda, MV; Montoya-Weiss, MM			Integrating operations and marketing perspectives of product innovation: The influence of organizational process factors and capabilities on development performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; technological innovation; development performance; time-to-market; project management; integrated performance measurement systems; interdisciplinary research	DEVELOPMENT CYCLE TIME; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ESTABLISHED FIRMS; PROJECT; INDUSTRY; TESTS; SHARE; REQUIREMENTS; DETERMINANTS	This paper adopts a multidisciplinary view of innovation by integrating operations and marketing perspectives of product development. The conceptual framework builds on the resource-based view of the firm and organizational information-processing theory to characterize relationships among organizational process factors, product development capabilities, critical uncertainties, and operational/market performance in product development projects. Data from a cross-sectional sample of 120 completed development projects for assembled goods is analyzed via a two-stage hierarchical moderated regression approach. The findings show that: (1) the organizational process factors studied are associated with achievement of operational outcome targets for product quality, unit cost, and time-to-market; (2) achievement of operational outcomes aids the achievement of market outcomes, in turn suggesting that development capabilities are indeed valuable firm resources; and (3) these relationships are robust under conditions of technological, market, and environmental uncertainty. This article provides practical insight into how product development projects can be better managed for operational and market success. Additionally, this article sets a theoretical and empirical basis for future research on the influence of organizational process factors and capabilities on diverse product-innovation outcomes.

J	Baiman, S; Fischer, PE; Rajan, MV				Baiman, S; Fischer, PE; Rajan, MV			Performance measurement and design in supply chains	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						buyer-supplier networks; agency theory; supply chains; performance measurement; product architecture	DOUBLE MORAL HAZARD; CONTRACTS; QUALITY; WARRANTIES	This paper examines the relationship between product architecture, supply-chain performance metrics, and supply-chain efficiency. We model the contracting relationship between a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is privately informed about the outcome of his design/production investment. The buyer both appraises the supplier's component and does further processing/component production of his own. If the final product produced by the buyer;exhibits decoupling and no function sharing with respect to the components (termed separable architecture), the first-best outcome is attained if both internal and external failures are contractible. When only one type of failure can be contracted on, we derive conditions under which contracting on internal failure is superior to contracting on external failure, and vice versa. If the buyer's final product has a nonseparable architecture with respect to the components, first-best cannot be achieved even if both internal and external failures are contractible. The value of contracting on internal failure alone is unaffected by the architecture design, while that of external failure declines relative to the separable setting; the net result is often to make the former the uniformly dominant performance metric. Our results highlight the interaction between the performance metrics used for contracting within the supply chain, the architecture of the product produced by the supply chain, and the incentive efficiency of the chain.

J	Novak, S; Eppinger, SD				Novak, S; Eppinger, SD			Sourcing by design: Product complexity and the supply chain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; product complexity; product architecture; property rights; transaction costs; vertical integration; automotive industry; supply chain management	VERTICAL INTEGRATION; AUTO INDUSTRY; COSTS; FIRM; ORGANIZATION; OWNERSHIP; DECISION	This paper focuses on the connection between product complexity and vertical integration I using original empirical evidence from the auto industry. A rich literature has addressed the choice between internal production and external sourcing of components in the auto industry. More recent literature has developed the concept of product architecture as another choice variable that may be one of the important contributors to product complexity. In this paper, we connect these two important decisions and study them jointly. We use the property rights approach to argue that complexity in product design and vertical integration of production are complements: that in-house production is more attractive when product complexity is high, as firms seek to capture the; benefits of their investment in the skills needed to coordinate development of complex designs. We test this hypothesis with a simultaneous equations model applied to data from the luxury-performance segment of the auto industry. We find a significant and positive relationship between product complexity and vertical integration. This has implications for optimal incentive structures within firms, as well as for interpreting firm performance.

It has also been argued and to some extent shown that such innovations will be found concentrated in a "lead user" segment of the user community. However, neither the characteristics of innovating users nor the scope of the community that they "lead" has been explored in depth. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of innovation, innovators, and innovation sharing by library users of OPAC information search systems in Australia. This market has capable users, but it is nonetheless clearly a "follower" with respect to worldwide technological advance. We find that 26% of users in this local market nonetheless do modify their OPACs in both major and minor ways, and that OPAC manufacturers judge many of these user modifications to be of commercial interest. We find that we can distinguish modifying from nonmodifying users on the basis of a number of factors, including their "leading-edge status" and their in-house technical capabilities. We find that many innovating users freely share their innovations with others, and find that we can distinguish users that share information about their modifications from users that do not. We conclude by considering some implications of our findings for idea generation practices in marketing.

The popular and academic literature contains descriptive studies on the mechanics of these systems and their perceived benefits. We use a model of production to analyze both informational and incentive rationales for reduced inventories. A TIT-like environment of low inventory levels is optimal in our model because it helps workers to better observe and understand the production process and to think and act creatively to improve operational reliability and yields. Empirical evidence using data obtained from 116 plants worldwide supports our conclusions about the effect of reduced inventories on process reliability, product quality, and cost.

J	Pratt, JW				Pratt, JW			Efficient risk sharing: The last frontier	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						group decision; Pareto efficiency; randomized choice; risk aversion; risk sharing; syndicate		When rational risk-averse agents must choose among and share monetary risks, it is known that efficient sharing is typically nonlinear, even with common beliefs. Wherever it is, the sharing rule may affect the choice, randomized choice may allow everyone to gain, and indeed a randomized choice between unacceptable risks may be acceptable. An important exception occurs if the agents' utility functions are all exponential, all logarithmic, or all the same power (HARA). Then choices should accord with a group utility function of the same form independent of the sharing rule, randomization never helps, and ail efficient sharing rules are linear. This self-contained paper simplifies, refines, and completes earlier analyses, identifying all exceptions; they are the linear sharing rules that make the agents' utilities agree. Aside from HARA, this can only occur for precisely one linear sharing rule or, in periodic versions of HARA, countably many.

The most critical resource for knowledge teams is expertise, or specialized skills and knowledge, but the mere presence of expertise on a team is insufficient to produce high-quality work. Expertise must be managed and coordinated in order to leverage its potential. That is, teams must be able to manage their skill and knowledge interdependencies effectively through expertise coordination, which entails knowing where expertise is located, knowing where expertise is needed, and bringing needed expertise to bear. This study investigates the importance of expertise coordination through a cross-sectional investigation of 69 software development teams. The analysis reveals that expertise coordination shows a strong relationship with team performance that remains significant over and above team input characteristics, presence of expertise, and administrative coordination.

Given these policy initiatives, housing mobility programs represent viable strategies for providing public housing residents with access to economically healthy, integrated neighborhoods. In this paper we present a decision support methodology to assist the design of housing mobility programs. This methodology incorporates economic models for estimating dollar-valued impacts associated with tenant relocation, and a multiobjective optimization model for generating alternative relocation schemes associated with various objective function weights. Using data for Lake County, Illinois and Chicago, we demonstrate that nondominated allocations represent significant trade-offs between dollar-valued and non-dollar-valued policy objectives; existing distributions of subsidized housing represent suboptimal solutions to the housing relocation problem; and increases in available rental housing can result in housing dispersion schemes that have positive net economic benefits relative to the status quo.

J	Xanthopulos, Z; Melachrinoudis, E; Solomon, MM				Xanthopulos, Z; Melachrinoudis, E; Solomon, MM			Interactive multiobjective group decision making with interval parameters	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Multiple Criteria Decision Making; group decision making; data mining		This paper proposes a new framework for the solution of interactive multiobjective group decision-making problems with interval parameters. Its novelty stems from a learning phase where decision makers (DMs) explore the structural characteristics of the specific Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. This provides important and timely feedback to the DMs. Its core consists of four indices and their relationships. The solution framework consists of three stages. In the first, each DM provides the limits of variation for each problem parameter. These are subsequently combined into a unique interval of variation. Then, the stochastic multiobjective problem is transformed into a deterministic one. In the second stage, DMs use the four MCDM characteristics to familiarize themselves with the problem before expressing their preferences for nondominated solutions. The DMs are then guided through an interactive procedure to find their best nondominated solutions. In the last stage, all best nondominated solutions provided by the DMs are combined using a twofold approach to find the best-compromise nondominated solution. This final choice represents the opinion of the group of DMs. Our results show that the learning phase is beneficial to DMs in judging the quality of solutions, leading to better informed decisions.

Under the assumptions that the production setup costs are negligible and that demand is seasonal but price dependent, we exploit the special structure of the problem to develop a solution procedure. Through a set of numerical examples, we demonstrate how a product's contribution to aggregate seasonality can increase its optimal price. Our examples also demonstrate that, among products that experience demand peaks during the firm's busy season, those that peak early in the busy season should be priced more aggressively than those that peak later.

J	Stiving, M				Stiving, M			Price-endings when prices signal quality	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						price-endings; quality; signaling; round prices	PRODUCT QUALITY; 9-ENDING PRICES	This paper provides a theoretical explanation for why firms behave as though they use round prices to signal quality. By replacing the linear demand curve in Bagwell and Riordan's (1991) price as a signal of quality model with a kinked demand curve, and analyzing what price endings firms are most likely to use, the following observations can be made: (1) Firms that are using high prices to signal quality are more likely to set those prices at round numbers, and (2) price-endings themselves are not necessarily signals of quality. A simulation was conducted to demonstrate that these findings generally hold true even in the presence of demand spikes at 9-ending prices (e.g., Schindler and Kibarian 1996). Finally, empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that firms tend to use more round prices for higher-quality products, and that this relationship is even stronger for product categories where consumers are less able to detect the true level of quality prior to purchase.

For practical scheduling environments, generalized set-covering formulations (GSCFs) of such problems often contain hundreds of millions of integer decision variables, usually precluding identification of optimal solutions. As an alternative, we present an implicit integer-programming model that frequently has fewer than 1,500 variables and can be formulated and solved using PC-based hardware and software platforms.

J	Repenning, NP				Repenning, NP			Drive out fear (unless you can drive it in): The role of agency and job security in process improvement	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process improvement; Total Quality Management; downsizing; repeated games	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; VALUE CREATION; PERFORMANCE	Understanding the wide range of outcomes achieved by firms trying to implement Total Quality Management (TQM) and similar process improvement initiatives presents a challenge to management theory: A few firms reap sustained benefits from their programs, but most efforts fail and are abandoned. In this paper I study one dimension of this phenomenon: the role of impending layoffs in determining employee commitment to process improvement. Currently, the literature provides two opposing theories concerning the effect of job security on the ability of firms to implement change initiatives. The "Drive Out Fear" school argues that firms must commit to job security, while the ''Drive In Fear'' school emphasizes the positive role that insecurity plays in motivating change. In this study a contract theoretic model is developed to analyze the role of agency in process improvement. The main insight of the study is that there are two types of job security, internal and external, that have opposing impacts on the firm's ability to implement improvement initiatives. The distinction is useful in explaining the results of different case studies and can reconcile the two change theories.

J	Donohue, KL				Donohue, KL			Efficient supply contracts for fashion goods with forecast updating and two production modes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply contracts; coordination; production planning; return option; value of information		We examine the problem of developing supply contracts that encourage proper coordination of forecast information and production decisions between a manufacturer and distributor of high fashion, seasonal products operating in a two-mode production environment. The first production mode is relatively cheap but requires a long lead time while the second is expensive but offers quick turnaround. We focus on contracts of the form (w(1), W-2, b) where w(i) is the wholesale price offered for production mode i and b is a return price offered for items left over at the end of the season. We find that such a contract can coordinate the manufacturer and distributor to act in the best interest of the channel. The pricing conditions needed to ensure an efficient solution vary depending on the degree of demand forecast improvement between periods and the manufacturer's access to forecast information. We also examine whether these conditions ensure a Pareto optimal solution with respect to two traditional production settings.

The objective is to find an ordering policy that minimizes the total expected procurement, inventory holding, and lost sales cost. Distinguishing characteristics of the system are the uncertainty and unobservability associated with return flows of used cameras. We model the system as a closed queueing network, develop a heuristic procedure for adaptive estimation and control, and illustrate our methods with disguised data from Kodak. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of various system characteristics such as informational structure, procurement delay, demand rate, and length of the product's life cycle.

Search takes place over a rugged landscape defined over the space of store practices. The main objective of this research is to determine how the amount of discretion given to store managers as to how they run their stores influences the rate of innovation at the store level. We find that greater decentralization enhances firm performance when stores' markets are sufficiently different, the horizon is sufficiently long, and markets are sufficiently stable.

J	Wang, YZ; Cohen, MA; Zheng, YS				Wang, YZ; Cohen, MA; Zheng, YS			A two-echelon repairable inventory system with stocking-center-dependent depot replenishment lead times	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; multi-echelon system; continuous-review; one-for-one policy; repairables; service-parts	FOR-ONE REPLENISHMENT; MULTI-ECHELON; MODELS; POLICY; APPROXIMATIONS; LOGISTICS; INDENTURE; ITEM	Consider a two-echelon repairable inventory system consisting of a central depot and multiple stocking centers. The centers provide parts replacement service to customers and replenish their inventory from the depot, following a one-for-one policy. The depot fills center replenishment orders on a first-come-first-serve basis. Defectives received at the centers are passed to the depot for repair and depot inventory replenishment. For this system, existing models (e.g., the METRIC model) usually assume that the depot replenishment lead times (DRLTs) are i.i.d., which however, does not fit well into the service parts logistics system that motivated this research. Because the DRLTs consist of the sum of repair times, defective return times, and transportation times, they are different across stocking centers, which are located globally. We study the impact of such center-dependent DRLTs on system performance. We derive probability distributions of the random delays at the depot experienced by center replenishment orders. We prove that a center with shorter DRLTs experiences shorter delays, and therefore, delivers better customer service. We show that for such systems, using the i.i.d. DRLT assumption introduces errors in estimating system performance. These errors become significant when both the demand rates and the depot planned inventory level are low.

J	Dasgupta, A; Ghosh, M				Dasgupta, A; Ghosh, M			Inducing performance in a queue via prices: The case of a riverine port	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queuing systems; discrete event simulation; simultaneous equations estimation; nonlinear programming	MARINE CONTAINER TERMINALS; PRODUCT QUALITY; SIMULATION; BALKING	To optimize large-scale queuing systems configurations, OR professionals typically use discrete event simulation packages to examine in detail the movement of entities through such systems, assuming stochastic but fixed arrival patterns. Demand aspects are, however, routinely ignored as few attempts are made to capture the feedback effect of queue performance on the arrival process. Econometricians, on the other hand, use a simultaneous equations estimation approach relying on past data, but they typically disregard the technological insights provided by simulation. This paper combines both tools to study the ailing port system of Calcutta, India, and concludes that raising prices will improve both economic and engineering performances. Microeconomic models of shipowner behavior are constructed to explain the nature of the empirical findings. Finally, full-equilibrium demand elasticities are calculated using the dual prices from an appropriate nonlinear program, which are then compared to the benchmark value expected of profit-maximizing behavior.

J	Bleichrodt, H; Pinto, JL				Bleichrodt, H; Pinto, JL			A parameter-free elicitation of the probability weighting function in medical decision analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						nonexpected utility; decision theory; probability weighting; utility assessment; medical decision making	UTILITY-ASSESSMENT; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISKY CHOICE; LIFE YEARS; PREFERENCE; UNCERTAINTY; RANK	An important reason why people violate expected utility theory is probability weighting. Previous studies on the probability weighting function typically assume a specific parametric form, exclude heterogeneity in individual preferences, and exclusively consider monetary decision making. This study presents a method to elicit the probability weighting function in rank-dependent expected utility theory that makes no prior assumptions about the functional form of the probability weighting function. We use both aggregate and individual subject data, thereby allowing for heterogeneity of individual preferences, and we examine probability weighting in a new domain, medical decision making. There is significant evidence of probability weighting both at the aggregate and at the individual subject level. The modal probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped, displaying both lower subadditivity and upper subadditivity. Probability weighting is in particular relevant at the boundaries of the unit interval. Compared to studies involving monetary outcomes, we generally find more elevation of the probability weighting function. The robustness of the empirical findings on probability weighting indicates its importance. Ignoring probability weighting in modeling decision under risk and in utility measurement is likely to lead to descriptively invalid theories and distorted elicitations.

The novelty of the method is that it is parameter-free, and thus elicits the whole individual preference functional without imposing any prior restriction. This method is used in an experimental study to elicit individual utility and probability weighting functions for monetary outcomes in the gain and loss domains. Concave utility functions are obtained for gains and convex utility functions for losses. The elicited weighting functions satisfy upper and lower subadditivity and are consistent with previous parametric estimations. The data also show that the probability weighting function for losses is more "elevated" than for gains.

J	Atuahene-Gima, K; Evangelista, F				Atuahene-Gima, K; Evangelista, F			Cross-functional influence in new product development: An exploratory study of marketing and R&D perspectives	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing and R&D interface; cross-functional influence; new product development	DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; INTERFACE; ANTECEDENTS; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; INNOVATION; MANAGERS; OUTCOMES	Previous research in new product development (NPD) has focused on the participation of marketing and R&D personnel, but little attention has been paid to their influence. This study examined the effects of marketing's and R&D's influence and participation on new product performance and the differential effects of personal, new product, and organizational factors on their influence in the NPD process as seen from each other's perspective. The results suggest that marketing's and R&D's self-reported influence and their influence as reported by the other have a differential impact on new product performance. Unlike R&D's participation as perceived by marketing, marketing's participation as perceived by R&D affects new product performance only when its influence is high. The results also suggest that marketing's and R&D's influence in the NPD process is differentially affected by personal, new product, and organizational factors.

J	DeCanio, SJ; Dibble, C; Amir-Atefi, K				DeCanio, SJ; Dibble, C; Amir-Atefi, K			The importance of organizational structure for the adoption of innovations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational theory; innovation; inequality; structural change; algorithmic computation		Organizational structure affects both the overall behavior of firms and the situations of individuals and subunits within firms. The effect of exogenous changes in the environment (market prices, costs, or regulations) on organizations can be partitioned into the immediate direct effect of the change and the full effect after organizational structure has had time to adjust. This paper develops a computational model of the diffusion of a profitable innovation through a firm, and uses numerical simulations to calculate the relative importance of the direct and structural adjustment components of changes in profitability. One finding is that a failure to recognize the importance of organizational structure on the performance of firms will lead to serious bias in estimation of the costs or benefits of a change in external circumstances. The type of network model developed also has implications for the individuals and divisions that make up the firm. We examine some of the structural characteristics of well-adapted organizations, and show that asymmetries and economic inequalities emerge even when the individual agents' personal characteristics are identical.

We conducted a longitudinal study of leading firms that were sponsoring new and competing product technologies in two industries: the videoplayer industry and the medical diagnostic imaging industry. We built original datasets on the actions of these firms, and then empirically examined the strategy process. Our findings indicate that the nature of the product technology, whether novel or evolved, and the market, whether concentrated or dispersed, influences when firms use technical or institutional strategies to get their new product technology accepted by the market.

The analysis is based on a multiclass fluid model for the dialysis facility, which combines a pharmacokinetics model of dialysis and an empirically validated model of dialysis-specific mortality. Assuming that the facility operates under budget and capacity constraints, our analysis determines the main factors that affect the delivery of dialysis. Numerical results, which are representative of the dialysis environment in the US, demonstrate the accuracy of the model and provide concrete insights about the operations of the dialysis facility. A major finding is that an improvement in the technology of dialysis is likely to have a more substantial impact on the overall Life expectancy of the dialysis population as compared to an increase in the dialysis reimbursement rate.

One, based on the expected I utility model is derived from responses to lotteries and direct scaling. The other measure is a psychometric approach based on Likert statements that produces a unidimensional risk attitude scale. The data are from computer-assisted interviews of 346 Dutch owner-managers of hog farms, who made decisions about their own businesses. While the measures demonstrate some degree of convergent validity, those measures based on lotteries were better predictors of actual market behavior. In contrast the psychometric scale showed more agreement to self-reported measures of innovativeness, market orientation, and the intention to reduce risk. In light of the higher predictive validity of lottery-based measurements, we recommend elicitation methods based on the expected utility paradigm.

Obtaining accurate estimates of such loss probabilities is essential to calculating value-at-risk, which is a quantile of the loss distribution. The method employs a quadratic (''delta-gamma'') approximation to the change in portfolio value to guide the selection of effective variance reduction techniques; specifically importance sampling and stratified sampling. If the approximation is exact, then the importance sampling is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Numerical results indicate that an appropriate combination of importance sampling and stratified sampling can result in large variance reductions when estimating the probability of large portfolio losses.

We describe a time-oriented branch-and-bound algorithm that uses constraint-propagation techniques which actively exploit the temporal and resource constraints of the problem in order to reduce the search space. Extensive computational experiments with systematically generated test problems show that the algorithm solves more problems to optimality than other exact solution procedures which have recently been proposed, and that the truncated version of the algorithm is also a very good heuristic.

J	Akesson, F; Lehoczky, JP				Akesson, F; Lehoczky, JP			Path generation for quasi-Monte Carlo simulation of mortgage-backed securities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; quasi-Monte Carlo; mortgage backed securities; Brownian Bridge; principal component decomposition; option pricing		Monte Carlo simulation is playing an increasingly important role in the pricing and hedging of complex, path dependent financial instruments. Low discrepancy simulation methods offer the potential to provide faster rates of convergence than those of standard Monte Carlo methods; however, in high dimensional problems special methods are required to ensure that the faster convergence rates hold. Indeed, Ninomiya and Tezuka (1996) have shown high-dimensional examples, in which low discrepancy methods perform worse than Monte Carlo methods. The principal component construction introduced by Acworth et al. (1998) provides one solution to this problem. However, the computational effort required to generate each path grows quadratically with the dimension of the problem. This article presents two new methods that offer accuracy equivalent, in terms of explained variability, to the principal components construction with computational requirements that are Linearly related to the problem dimension. One method is to take into account knowledge about the payoff function, which makes it more flexible than the Brownian Bridge construction. Numerical results are presented that show the benefits of such adjustments. The different methods are compared for the case of pricing mortgage backed securities using the Hull-White term structure model.

J	Browne, S				Browne, S			Risk-constrained dynamic active portfolio management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						portfolio theory; benchmarking; active portfolio management; stochastic control	CONTINUOUS-TIME; PROBABILITY; INVESTMENT; STRATEGIES	Active portfolio management is concerned with objectives related to the outperformance of the return of a target benchmark portfolio. In this paper, we consider a dynamic active portfolio management problem where the objective is related to the tradeoff between the achievement of performance goals and the risk of a shortfall. Specifically, we consider an objective that relates the probability of achieving a given performance objective to the time it takes to achieve the objective. This allows a new direct quantitative analysis of the risk/return tradeoff, with risk defined directly in terms of probability of shortfall relative to the benchmark, and return defined in terms of the expected time to reach investment goals relative to the benchmark. The resulting optimal policy is a state-dependent policy that provides new insights. As a special case, our analysis includes the case where the investor wants to minimize the expected time until a given performance goal is reached subject to a constraint on the shortfall probability.

J	D'Amato, RM; D'Aquila, RT; Wein, LM				D'Amato, RM; D'Aquila, RT; Wein, LM			Management of antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection: Analyzing when to change therapy	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						AIDS; stochastic modeling; censored measurements; Slepian's inequality	PLASMA; SUPPRESSION; VIRUS; RNA	We analyze two joint decisions in the management of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy: how frequently to measure a patient's virus level, and when to switch therapy. The underlying stochastic model captures the initial suppression and eventual rebound of the virus level in the blood of a typical HIV-infected patient undergoing treatment. We consider two classes of policies: a viral load policy, which triggers a change in therapy when the current virus level divided by the smallest level achieved thus far exceeds a prespecified threshold, and a proactive policy, which is similar to the viral load policy but also switches drugs at a prespecified time if no evidence of viral rebound has been seen. We find approximate analytical expressions for the probability of switching before the virus reaches its nadir (minimum value) and the mean delay in detection of viral rebound (i.e., the time interval from when the viral nadir occurs until the switch in therapy). Numerical results show that the proactive policy outperforms (i.e., a smaller detection delay for a given probability of prenadir switching) the viral load policy and recent recommendations by an expert AIDS panel, and may delay the onset of multidrug resistance in a significant proportion of patients who experience drug failure.

It also contains some new results and ideas. The aim is to examine the basic principles supporting these methods and how they can be used effectively for the simulation models that are typically encountered in the area of management science. These models can usually be reformulated as integration problems over the unit hypercube with a large (sometimes infinite) number of dimensions. We examine selection criteria for the lattice rules and suggest criteria which take into account the quality of the projections of the lattices over selected low-dimensional subspaces. The criteria are strongly related to those used for selecting linear congruential and multiple recursive random number generators. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

J	Van Mieghem, JA				Van Mieghem, JA			Price and service discrimination in queuing systems: Incentive compatibility of Gc mu scheduling	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; quality of service (QoS); differentiation; queuing; incentive compatibility; asymmetric information; delay costs; scheduling; dynamic priority; generalized c mu rule; threshold rules	EQUILIBRIUM; QUALITY	This article studies the optimal prices and service quality grades that a queuing system-the "firm"-provides to heterogeneous, utility-maximizing customers who measure quality by their experienced delay distributions. Results are threefold: First, delay cost curves are introduced that allow for a flexible description of a customer's quality sensitivity. Second, a comprehensive executable approach is proposed that analytically specifies scheduling, delay distributions and prices for arbitrary delay sensitivity curves. The tractability of this approach derives from porting heavy-traffic Brownian results into the economic analysis. The generalized c mu (Gc mu) scheduling rule that emerges is dynamic so that, in general, service grades need not correspond to a static priority ranking. A benchmarking example investigates the value of differentiated service. Third, the notions of grade and rate incentive compatibility (IC) are introduced to study this system under asymmetric information and are established for Gc mu scheduling when service times are homogeneous and customers atomistic. Grade IC induces correct grade choice resulting in perfect service discrimination; rate IC additionally induces centralized-optimal rates. Dynamic Gc mu scheduling exhibits negative feedback that, together with time-dependent pricing, can also yield rate incentive compatibility with heterogeneous service times.

J	Zaric, GS; Brandeau, ML; Barnett, PG				Zaric, GS; Brandeau, ML; Barnett, PG			Methadone maintenance and HIV prevention: A cost-effectiveness analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						health; public policy; cost-effectiveness analysis; methadone; HIV/AIDS	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; INTRAVENOUS-DRUG-USERS; OUT-OF-TREATMENT; COCAINE USE; RISK BEHAVIOR; SAN-FRANCISCO; CHILDBEARING AGE; SCREENING WOMEN; ABUSE TREATMENT; UNITED-STATES	We assess the cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatment for heroin addiction, with emphasis on its role in preventing HIV infection. The analysis is based on a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic among a population of adults, ages 18 to 44. The population is divided into nine compartments according to infection status and risk group. The model takes into account disease transmission from drug injection and sexual contacts. The health benefits of methadone maintenance and the resulting HIV infections averted are measured in terms of Life years gained and quality-adjusted life years gained. Costs considered include all health-care costs (including cost of HIV care and other health care) and the cost of methadone maintenance. The analysis shows that expanding existing methadone maintenance programs is a cost-effective health-care intervention that can play an important role in slowing the spread of HIV and improving the length and quality of life for injection drug users (IDUs), and that such expansion is cost-effective even in populations with low HIV prevalence among IDUs. Incremental expansion of methadone maintenance programs was found to have a cost-effectiveness ratio of between $9,700 and $17,200 per life year gained, and between $6,300 and $10,900 per quality-adjusted Life year gained. Although methadone maintenance treatment is provided to IDUs,the analysis shows that significant benefits accrue to non-IDU members of the population. Sensitivity analysis shows that new methadone maintenance treatment slots will be cost-effective even if they are twice as expensive and half as effective in reducing risky behavior as current methadone maintenance programs.

J	Cachon, GP; Fisher, M				Cachon, GP; Fisher, M			Supply chain inventory management and the value of shared information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain; multi-echelon inventory management; periodic review policies; electronic data interchange	DEMAND INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; POLICIES	In traditional supply chain inventory management, orders are the only information firms exchange, but information technology now allows firms to share demand and inventory data quickly and inexpensively. We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding: costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. in a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: Ln the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information.

To solve them successfully requires the coordinated actions of many functional representatives acting in a decentralized setting. Functional managers, however, respond to their own individual incentives and may consequently fail to maximize the overall profits of the firm. We examine this issue in a setting in which the output of early actions limits the range of later actions, and we propose an incentive scheme that allows the system to be successfully decentralized. Our mechanism is based on linear transfer prices for the intermediate output that are implemented through an internal market; a market maker buys the output from one function and sells it to another. She is not obliged to sell at the same price at which she bought and may set prices solely to provide incentives. We illustrate the flexibility of the scheme by applying it to several models in the operations management literature.

J	Dowell, G; Hart, S; Yeung, B				Dowell, G; Hart, S; Yeung, B			Do corporate global environmental standards create or destroy market value?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						direct investment in developing countries; firm value; firm-level environmental policy	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; FIRM	Arguments can be made on both sides of the question of whether a stringent global corporate environmental standard represents a competitive asset or Liability for multinational enterprises (MNEs) investing in emerging and developing markets. Analyzing the global environmental standards of a sample of U.S.-based MNEs in relation to their stock market performance, we find that firms adopting a single stringent global environmental standard have much higher market values, as measured by Tobin's q, than firms defaulting to less stringent, or poorly enforced host country standards. Thus, developing countries that use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, firms. Our results also suggest that externalities are incorporated to a significant extent in firm valuation. We discuss plausible reasons for this observation.

We develop a game-theoretic model to understand how firm and industry characteristics moderate the effect of market information on firm profits. Our results suggest that information is more valuable when product substitutability is higher, suggesting that information is of greater value in more competitive industries. Our results also suggest that although industry size does not affect the value of information, information is more valuable for larger firms. We find that, except under some conditions, more precise market information has a greater impact on profits in a Stackelberg mode of conduct than in a Bertrand-Nash mode.

J	Dennis, D; Meredith, J				Dennis, D; Meredith, J			An empirical analysis of process industry transformation systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process industry; production; transformation systems; taxonomy; configurations	PRODUCT	recess industries share many characteristics because their transformation systems are designed for nondiscrete materials. Hence, the process industries typically are lumped together in a general group and contrasted from the discrete industries as a whole. The result is a poor understanding of the differences between distinct types of process industries. In this article, 19 different process industry sites are analyzed for the purpose of identifying the key differences between their transformation systems. Using cluster analysis, seven major subtypes of process industries are identified within the sample: (1) process job shop, (2) fast batch, (3) custom blending, (4) stock hybrid, (5) custom hybrid, (6) multistage continuous, and (7) rigid continuous. It is shown how these seven subtypes differ on the composite dimensions of (1) materials diversity, (2) equipment, (3) materials movement, and (4) run time. The research and managerial implications of these results are discussed.

J	Clemen, RT; Fischer, GW; Winkler, RL				Clemen, RT; Fischer, GW; Winkler, RL			Assessing dependence: Some experimental results	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						correlation; concordance probability; covariation judgment; dependence; Spearman's rho; subjective assessment	COVARIATION; RISK; JUDGMENTS; COPULAS	Constructing decision- and risk-analysis probability models often requires measures of dependence among variables.;Although data are sometimes available to estimate such measures, in many applications they must be obtained by means of subjective judgment by experts. We discuss two experimental studies that compare the accuracy of six different methods for assessing dependence. Our results lead to several conclusions: First, simply asking experts to report a correlation is a reasonable approach. Direct estimation-is more accurate than the other methods studied, is not prone to mathematically inconsistent responses (as are some other measures), and is judged to be less difficult than alternate methods. In addition, directly assessed correlations showed less variability than the correlations derived from other assessment methods. Our results also show that experience with the variables can improve performance somewhat, as can training in a given assessment method. Finally, if a judge uses several different assessment methods, an average of the resulting estimates can also lead to better performance.

J	Hansen, AT; Jorgensen, PL				Hansen, AT; Jorgensen, PL			Analytical valuation of American-style Asian options	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Asian options; American options; analytical valuation formulas; numerical work; change of numeraire	AVERAGE; ASSET	This article derives the first analytical pricing formulas for American-style Asian options of the so-called floating strike type. Geometric as well as arithmetic averaging Is considered. The setup is a standard Black-Scholes framework where the price of the underlying security evolves according to a geometric Brownian motion. A decomposition result that splits up the value of the floating strike American option into the price of an otherwise equivalent European option and an early exercise premium is first presented. This decomposition result is then manipulated further for the two separate types of averaging. With geometric averaging we derive an exact pricing formula, whereas with arithmetic averaging we develop an analytical approximation formula that proves to be very precise. Numerical examples are provided.

J	Hsu, A; Wilcox, RT				Hsu, A; Wilcox, RT			Stochastic prediction in multinomial logit models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						choice models; econometric modeling	BEHAVIOR	It is standard practice to form predictions from multinomial logit models by ignoring the estimation error associated with the parameter estimates and solving for the predicted endogeneous variable (market share) in terms of the exogenous variables and the point estimates of the parameters. It has long been recognized in the econometrics literature that this type of nonstochastic prediction, which ignores the sampling distribution of the parameter estimates, leads to incorrect inferences about the endogenous variable. We offer a simulation-based approach for approximating the exact stochastic prediction. We show that this approach provides very accurate approximations with minimal computation time and would be easy to implement in industrial applications.

SPI (Structure-Passing Interface) is a program that retrieves structure new concept is proposed for linking algebraic modeling languages with structure from an anonymous mathematical program built by an algebraic modeling language. SPI passes the special structure of the problem to an SES (Structure-Exploiting Solver). An integration of SPI and SES leads to SET (Structure-Exploiting Tool) and can be used with any algebraic modeling language. This approach relies on the idea that most exploitable block structures can be easily detected from the algebraic formulation of models. It should enable algebraic modeling languages to access the large body of algorithmic techniques which require problem structure.

J	Hsu, VN				Hsu, VN			Dynamic economic lot size model with perishable inventory	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						economic lot sizing; perishable inventory; dynamic programming	SIZING PROBLEM; ALGORITHMS; COSTS; COMPLEXITY; SETUPS; TIME; N)	This paper considers an economic lot size (ELS) model for perishable products where an inventory stock's deterioration rate and its carrying cost in each period depend on the age of the stock. We discuss situations where the traditional ELS models are not applicable, and propose a new model with general concave production and inventory cost functions, We explore the structural properties of the optimal solutions and use them to develop a dynamic programming algorithm which solves the problem in polynomial time. We also consider special cases of the general model which are solvable with reduced computational complexities.

J	So, KC; Tang, CS				So, KC; Tang, CS			Modeling the impact of an outcome-oriented reimbursement policy on clinic, patients, and pharmaceutical firms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						health care; mathematical model; management	LIFE; CARE	Tackling the steep increase in drug costs is an especially important issue among many health care providers and insurers. To entice the clinics to become more cost efficient, the U.S. federal government, as well as many HMOs, have developed various cost containment initiatives recently. However, the impact of these initiatives on the patients' well-being, the clinic's profitability, and the pharmaceutical firm's profitability has nor been formally analyzed. Tn this paper we develop a mathematical model that is intended to examine the impact of a reimbursement policy for drug usage. Despite the simplistic structure of our model, the analysis enhances our understanding of the joint impact of the reimbursement policy on the patients, the clinic, and the pharmaceutical firm. Thus, our analysis can provide valuable information for evaluating the effectiveness of implementing such a reimbursement policy. In addition, we utilize the data gathered from a clinic to help support the assumptions and results of the underlying model.

Although these two factors are not directly observable, they may be estimated from spot and futures prices. Intuitively, movements in prices for long-maturity futures contracts provide information about the equilibrium price level, and differences between the prices for the short- and long-term contracts provide information about short-term variations in prices. We show that, although this model does not explicitly consider changes in convenience yields over time, this short-term/long-term model is equivalent to the stochastic convenience yield model developed in Gibson and Schwartz (1990). We estimate the parameters of the model using prices for oil futures contracts and apply the model to some hypothetical oil-linked assets to demonstrate its use and some of its advantages over the Gibson-Schwartz model.

J	Carr, S; Lovejoy, W				Carr, S; Lovejoy, W			The inverse newsvendor problem: Choosing an optimal demand portfolio for capacitated resources	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						newsvendor; newsboy; yield management; capacity allocation; demand management	ASSET REVENUE MANAGEMENT; YIELD MANAGEMENT; DECISION RULES; OVERBOOKING	The classical newsvendor problem is one of optimally choosing a level of capacity to respond to a known demand distribution. The inverse newsvendor problem is one of optimally choosing a demand distribution with fixed capacity. The applications of the inverse problem include industrial settings where demand management is relatively less costly than capacity adjustments. Demand distributions are chosen from an opportunity set, which reflects the set of market opportunities for the firm. We analyze the firm's profit as a function of these demand alternatives, provide solution methods and insights, and identify inefficient and dominated distributions. We provide results when the opportunity set is known or only partially known. We extend the results to cases in which there are multiple prioritized customer classes that share the firm's productive capacity. This paper was motivated by an industrial application in a firm selling a semicommodity product into three prioritized industrial sectors. We review the application of our methods to this setting.

J	Tyagi, RK				Tyagi, RK			Sequential product positioning under differential costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product positioning; sequential entry; first-mover advantage; game theory	PRICE-COMPETITION; ADVANTAGE; MARKET	This paper examines the product positioning decisions of firms that enter a market sequentially and that have potentially different cost structures. It shows that if the first mover knows the second mover to have a lower production cost, it positions away from the most attractive location in the market; further, the larger the second-mover's cost advantage, the farther away the first mover positions from the most attractive location. The payer also models uncertainty in the first-mover's mind about the later-entrant's cost structure, and shows that an increase in this uncertainty (in the sense of mean-preserving spread) also makes the first mover position farther from the most attractive location in the market. Overall, this payer suggests that unless the first entrant in a market is certain that the later entrant will not have a superior cost structure, it may be better off leaving the best position in the market vacant and having a niche or fringe product.

J	Feng, YY; Gallego, C				Feng, YY; Gallego, C			Perishable asset revenue management with Markovian time dependent demand intensities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic pricing; yield management; stopping times; intensity control; martingales; finite horizon; optimal policies	AIRLINE YIELD MANAGEMENT; SEAT INVENTORY CONTROL; FARE CLASSES; OVERBOOKING; MODEL	Many industries face the problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal items with long procurement lead times. Given a sunk investment in seats, rooms, or winter coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize expected revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing of price changes within a given menu of allowable, possibly time dependent, price paths each of which is associated with a general Poisson process with Markovian, time dependent, predictable intensities. We show that a set of variational inequalities characterize the value functions and the optimal (possibly random) time changes. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal value functions and the optimal pricing policy.

The objective is to minimize the maximum individual risk and we use an l(infinity) function as the risk measure. We provide an explicit analytical solution for the model and are thus able to Plot the entire efficient frontier. Our selection rule is very conservative. One of the features of the solution is that it does not explicitly involve the covariance of the asset returns.

This problem, which is known to be NP-hard, has applications in transportation planning and in location analysis. In this paper we derive dominance rules for the problem solutions that allow a tightening of the bounds on the problem variables and improve the efficiency of a known branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, we present some heuristics and compare them with two different modifications of an EOQ-type algorithm for the solution of the problem with continuous frequencies.

The effects of product size, personnel capability, software process, usage of tools, and higher front-end investments on productivity and conformance quality were analyzed to derive managerial implications based on primary data collected on commercial software projects from a leading vendor. Our key findings are as follows. First, our results provide evidence for significant increases in life-cycle productivity from improved conformance quality in software products shipped to the customers. Given that the expenditure on computer software has been growing over the last few decades, empirical evidence for cost savings through quality improvement is a significant contribution to the literature. Second, our study identifies several quality drivers in software products. Our findings indicate that higher personnel capability, deployment of resources in initial stages of product development (especially design) and improvements in software development process factors are associated with higher quality products.

The approach uses only historical observations of the relative frequencies of certain seat-filling events to guide direct adjustments of the seat protection levels in accordance with the optimality conditions of Brumelle and McGill (1993). Stochastic approximation theory is used to prove the convergence of this adaptive algorithm to the optimal protection levels. in a simulation study, we compare the revenue performance of this adaptive approach to a more traditional method that combines a censored forecasting method with a common seat allocation heuristic (EMSR-b).

J	Baiman, S; Fischer, PE; Rajan, MV				Baiman, S; Fischer, PE; Rajan, MV			Information, contracting, and quality costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information; incentives; quality costs; supply chain	SUPPLIER	This article analyzes the relation between product quality, the cost of quality, and the information that can be contracted upon. We consider a setting where a risk neutral supplier sells an intermediate product to a risk neutral buyer. The supplier incurs prevention costs to reduce the probability of selling a defective product, and the buyer incurs appraisal costs to identify defects. Both decisions are subject to moral hazard. We show that the first-best outcome can be obtained if either: (i) the supplier's prevention decision is contractible; or (ii) the buyer's appraisal decision and either internal failure (i.e., the product's failing the buyer's appraisal test) or external failure (i.e., the product's failing after being sold by the buyer) are contractible events; or (iii) both internal and external failure are contractible events. We then focus on the second-best setting where actions and failures are not contractible and study the effect of making the buyer's appraisal result contractible. Relative to first-best, if a buyer's return decision is contractible (but not his appraisal result), the supplier incurs lower prevention costs, the buyer incurs higher appraisal costs, expected internal failure costs are higher, and the total cost of quality is higher. The expected costs of external failure, however, may actually be lower relative to first-best. We then show that installing an information system that makes the appraisal result contractible reduces the inefficiency associated with the seller's prevention activity, increases the inefficiency associated with the buyer's quality appraisal activity, and unambiguously improves product quality.

The preparation of financial statements involves extensive aggregation-information regarding several transactions is summarized using a few account balances. In this article, we study Linear, double-entry aggregation rules. The level of aggregation (transactions versus account balance information) affects a decision maker's ability to discriminate between two entities. We show Brat the orientation of the discriminant function relative to the row space and the nullspace (two fundamental subspaces) of the double-entry matrix determines the information loss due to aggregation. In addition, we observe that an interdependency in account balances is introduced by the double-entry process. The cause and effect property (debit and credit) translates into a negative covariance being introduced among account balances; this, in turn, affects the decision maker's optimal use of information. Finally, in discussing benefits to aggregation, we present an example in which adopting a double-entry aggregation rule serves as a commitment device for the owner.

J	Kuntz, L; Scholtes, S				Kuntz, L; Scholtes, S			Measuring the robustness of empirical efficiency valuations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						data envelopment analysis; hospital capacity planning; sensitivity analysis	SENSITIVITY; DEA	We study the robustness of empirical efficiency valuations of production processes in an extended Farrell model. Based on input and output data, an empirical efficiency status-efficient or inefficient-is assigned to each of the processes. This status may change if the data of the observed processes change. As illustrated by a capacity planning problem for hospitals in Germany, the need arises to gauge the robustness of empirical efficiency valuations. The example suggests to gauge the robustness of the efficiency valuation for a process with respect to perturbations of prespecified elements of the data. A natural measure of robustness is the minimal perturbation, in terms of a suitable distance function, of the chosen data elements that is necessary to change the efficiency status of the process under investigation. Farrell's (1957) efficiency score is an example of such a robustness measure. We give further examples of relevant data perturbations for which the robustness measure can be computed efficiently. We then focus on weighted maximum norm distance functions, such as the maximal absolute or percentage deviation, but allow for independent perturbations of the elements of an arbitrary a priori fixed subset of the data. In this setting, the robustness measure is naturally related to a certain threshold value for a Linear monotone one-parameter family of perturbations and can be calculated by means of a Linear programming-based bisection method. Closed form solutions in terms of Farrell's efficiency score are obtained for specific perturbations, Following the theoretical developments, we revisit the hospital capacity planning problem to illustrate the managerial relevance of our techniques.

J	Rivkin, JW				Rivkin, JW			Imitation of complex strategies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						imitation; complexity; interactions; competitive advantage	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RUGGED LANDSCAPES; TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEMS; PERSISTENCE; INDUSTRY; MODEL	Researchers examining loosely coupled systems, knowledge management, and complementary practices in organizations have proposed, informally, that the complexity of a successful business strategy can deter imitation of the strategy. This paper explores this proposition rigorously. A simple model is developed that parametrizes the two aspects of strategic complexity: the number of elements in a strategy and the interactions among those elements. The model excludes conventional resource-based and game-theoretic barriers to imitation altogether. The model is used to show that complexity makes the search for an optimal strategy intractable in the technical sense of the word provided by the theory of NP-completeness. Consequently, would-be copycats must rely on search heuristics or on learning, not on algorithmic "solutions," to match the performance of superior firms. However, complexity also undermines heuristics and learning, in the face of complexity, firms that follow simple hill-climbing heuristics are quickly snared on low "local peaks," and firms that try to learn and mimic a high performer's entire strategy suffer large penalties from small errors. The model helps to explain why some winning strategies remain unmatched even though they are open to public scrutiny; why certain bundles of organizational practices diffuse slowly even though they lead to superior performance; and why some strategies yield superior returns even after many of their critical ingredients are adopted by competitors. The analysis also suggests roles for management science and managerial choice in a world of complex strategies.

J	Herer, YT; Raz, T				Herer, YT; Raz, T			Optimal parallel inspection for finding the first nonconforming unit in a batch - An information theoretic approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inspection planning; information theory	SEARCH	We consider the case of a batch of discrete units produced by a process subject to failures under a known probability distribution function, and apply information theory to the problem of finding the first nonconforming unit in the batch at minimum cost. Two distinct but related aspects of this problem were treated: determining which units should be inspected, and determining how many units should be sent for inspection at the same time. The solution is based on the principles of inspecting the product units that maximize the reduction in the uncertainty regarding the location of the first nonconforming unit, and of minimizing the cost per unit of uncertainty reduced. These principles are formalized by means of a series of theorems leading to an easy-to-implement algorithm for managing parallel inspection. This approach is successfully compared with the optimal solution obtained with dynamic programming and with other heuristics.

In accordance with neoclassical production economics, this possibility set has convex projections into the input and output spaces (convex isoquants), and it satisfies the assumption of free disposability. We obtain it by means of a possibly infinite recursion which builds the possibility set as an ever larger union of convex Sets. We remark on the nature of the approximations obtained by truncating the recursion, and we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition, checkable in one iteration for the recursion to stop in the next. For the case in which the recursion stops, we provide a succinct characterization of the dominance relations among the constituent sets produced by the procedure. Finally, we present examples of both finite and infinite cases. The example for the finite case illustrates the construction of the possibility set along with its associated production and consumption sets.

Based on the organizational learning literature, we derive a quality learning curve that links different types of learning in quality improvement projects to the evolution of the factory's waste rate. Only 25% of the quality improvement projects-which acquired both know-why and know-how-accelerated waste reduction. The other 75% of the projects either impeded or did not affect waste reduction. In complex and dynamic production environments, locally acquired knowledge is difficult to disseminate. The combination of know-why and know-how facilitates its dissemination.

We found that group performance was contingent on the distribution of knowledge within the group and networks of social relationships among group members. Studying 39 teams of MBA students in two management simulation games, we found that, in general, groups that had broadly distributed knowledge, i.e., groups made up of members who had general knowledge, outperformed groups that had knowledge concentrated in different members, i.e., groups made up of members who had specialized or both specialized and general knowledge. However, the advantage that the former enjoyed over the latter disappeared when groups of specialists or mixed groups had decentralized network structures.

While the literature on such initiatives in the business press is proliferating, it is not clear how one can quantify the benefits of these initiatives and how one can identify the drivers of the magnitudes of these benefits. Using analytical models, this paper aims at addressing these questions for a simple two-level supply chain with nonstationary end demands. Our analysis suggests that the value of demand information sharing can be quite high, especially when demands are significantly correlated over time.

We assume that perishable assets are offered at a set of discrete price levels. Demand at each level is a Poisson process. To maximize the expected revenue, management controls the price dynamically as sales evolve. We show that a subset of these prices that form a concave envelope is potentially optimal. We formulate the problem into an intensity control model and derive the optimal solution in closed form. Properties of the optimal solution and their policy implementations are discussed. Numerical examples are provided.

In contrast to conventional wisdom according to which the difference between hedging through forward contracts and futures is immaterial, it turns out that the minimum variance hedge ratio using forwards comprises two terms instead of one only when using futures. The magnitude of the difference between the two hedge ratios may be important under some plausible assumptions. This result is due to the presence of additional interest rate risk that bears on the profit-and-loss statement associated with the forward position. This sheds some additional light on the respective features of forward and futures contracts written on interest rate-sensitive securities.

J	Fischer, GW; Jia, JM; Luce, MF				Fischer, GW; Jia, JM; Luce, MF			Attribute conflict and preference uncertainty: The RandMAU model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						attribute conflict; preference uncertainty; random multiattribute utility	RESPONSE ERROR; CHOICE; JUDGMENT	This paper extends the behavioral results reported in Fischer et al. (2000) by developing a model addressing preference uncertainty in multiattribute evaluation. The model is motivated by two hypotheses regarding properties of multiattribute profiles that lead to greater preference uncertainty. Our attribute conflict hypothesis predicts that greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an alternative) leads to more preference uncertainty. Our attribute extremity hypothesis predicts that greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) leads to less preference uncertainty. To provide a deeper explanation of attribute conflict and extremity effects, we develop RandMAU, a family of additive (RandAUF) and multiplicative (RandMUF) random weights multiattribute utility models. In RandMAU models, preference uncertainty is represented as random variation in both the weighting parameters governing trade-offs among attributes and the curvature parameters governing single-attribute evaluations. Simulation results show that RandMUF successfully predicts both the attribute conflict and attribute extremity effects exhibited by the experimental participants in Fischer et al. (2000). It also predicts an outcome value effect on error whose form depends on the shape of single-attribute functions and on the type of multiattribute combination rule.

Traditional techniques to address this issue (e.g., cluster analysis) often require, either ex ante or ex post, the exogenous specification of the number of groups to be employed in further analysis-and are not especially suited to dealing with distributions over time. The methodology presented here iteratively applies the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test to identify the number and membership of statistically significantly different performance strata on a longitudinal basis. Monte Carlo simulations compare the new methodology with traditional clustering techniques. An application that stratifies mutual funds by returns illustrates the technique.

The procedure interactively solves a relaxed subproblem to identify potential entering basic columns. The subproblem is chosen to exploit special structure, rendering it easy to solve. The effect of the procedure is the reduction of the number of pivots needed to solve the problem. Our approach is motivated by the column-generation approach of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. We test our procedure on two sets of multicommodity flow problems. One group of test problems arises in routing telecommunications traffic and the second group is a set of logistics problem which have been widely used to test multicommodity flow algorithms.

J	Sprecher, A				Sprecher, A			Scheduling resource-constrained projects competitively at modest memory requirements	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						project scheduling; resource constraints; single-mode; branch-and-bound; heuristic; computational results	MULTIPLE RESOURCE; BOUND ALGORITHM; BRANCH	We consider the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The purpose of this paper is to direct and focus to a branch-and-bound concept that can, by simple adaptations, operate on a wide range of problem settings. The general approach can, e.g., deal with multimode problems, resource availability varying with time, and a wide range of objectives. Even the simple assembly Lint balancing problem of type-1 can be competitively approached with some modifications. Although the algorithm is the most general and simple one currently available for resource-constrained project scheduling, the computational performance can compete with the best approaches available for the single-mode problem. The algorithm uses far less memory than the state-of-the-art procedure, i.e., 256 KB versus 24 MB, for solving the standard benchmark set with projects consisting of 32 activities within comparable time. if both approaches are allowed to make limited use of memory, i.e., 256 KB, then more than 97% of the benchmark instances can be solved within fractions of the time required by the current state-of-the-art procedure. The truncated version of our algorithm achieves at 256 KB approximately the results of the truncated version of the state-of-the-art approach at 24 MB. Since in general the memory requirements exponentially grow with the number of activities the project consists of, memory will become a critical resource, and the strategy to access previously stored information will gain fundamental importance when solving larger projects.

To use be - prod, the user needs to formulate his/her problem as a mixed integer program using XPRESS-MP's mp - model, a standard mathematical programming modelling language, taking into account a reserved set of key words for specific lot-sizing objects, such as production variables, storage, and demand data, etc. The problem is then solved by the XPRESS-MP branch-and-bound system including lot-sizing specific preprocessing, cutting planes for different aspects of lot-sizing problems, plus general cutting planes, and a lot-sizing-specific primal heuristic. Results are presented for a wide variety of big bucket and small bucket models with set-up and start-up costs and times.

J	Song, JS				Song, JS			A note on assemble-to-order systems with batch ordering	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						assemble-to-order systems; performance evaluation; multivariate compound Poisson process; (R, nQ) policy; Markov chain; uniform distribution	INVENTORY POLICIES	We study an assemble-to-order inventory system. The stocks are held for components, with final products assembled only when customer orders are realized. Customer orders form a multivariate compound Poisson process, component replenishment leadtimes are constant, and demands in excess of inventory on hand are backlogged. The component inventories are controlled by (R, nQ) policies. We show that under certain general conditions the inventory position vector has a uniform equilibrium distribution. This result generalizes the corresponding single-item theory considerably. It allows us to express the key performance measures of the system, such as order fill rates and average order-based backorders, as the averages of their counterparts in the base-stock systems.

J	Harter, DE; Krishnan, MS; Slaughter, SA				Harter, DE; Krishnan, MS; Slaughter, SA			Effects of process maturity on quality, cycle time, and effort in software product development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software process improvement; software economics; software productivity; software quality; software costs; software cycle time; capability maturity model	REGRESSION; ECONOMIES; MODELS; SCALE; COST	The information technology (IT) industry is characterized by rapid innovation and intense competition. To survive, IT firms must develop high quality software products on time and at low cost. A key issue is whether high levels of quality can be achieved without adversely impacting cycle time and effort. Conventional beliefs hold that processes to improve software quality can be implemented only at the expense of longer cycle times and greater development effort. However, an alternate view is that quality improvement, faster cycle time, and effort reduction can be simultaneously attained by reducing defects and rework. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between process maturity, quality, cycle time, and effort for the development of 30 software products by a major IT firm. We find that higher levels of process maturity as assessed by the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model(TM) are associated with higher product quality, but also with increases in development effort. However, our findings indicate that the reductions in cycle time and effort due to improved quality outweigh the increases from achieving higher levels of process maturity. Thus, the net effect of process maturity is reduced cycle time and development effort.

J	Lee, HL; Padmanabhan, V; Taylor, TA; Whang, SJ				Lee, HL; Padmanabhan, V; Taylor, TA; Whang, SJ			Price protection in the personal computer industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						channel coordination; supply chain management; computer industry; incentives; inventory management	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; RETURNS POLICIES; PRODUCTS	Price protection is a commonly used practice between manufacturers and retailers in the personal computer (PC) industry, motivated by drastic declines of product values during the product life cycle. It is a form of rebate given by the manufacturer to the retailer for units unsold at the retailer when the price drops during the product life cycle. It is a controversial policy in the PC industry because it is not clear how such a policy benefits the supply chain and its participants. We show that price protection is an instrument for channel coordination. For products with long manufacturing lead times, so the retailer has a single buying opportunity, a properly chosen price protection credit coordinates the channel. For products with shorter manufacturing lead times, so the retailer has two buying opportunities, price protection alone cannot guarantee channel coordination when wholesale prices are exogenous. However, when the price protection credit is set endogenously together with the wholesale prices, channel coordination is restored. In the two-buying-opportunity setting with fixed wholesale prices, we show that price protection has two primary impacts: (1) shifting sales forward in time and (2) increasing total sales. Finally, we present a simple numerical example that suggests, given the current economics of the PC industry, that price protection under fixed wholesale prices may benefit the total chain and the retailer but hurt the manufacturer.

J	Dewan, R; Freimer, M; Seidmann, A				Dewan, R; Freimer, M; Seidmann, A			Organizing distribution channels for information goods on the Internet	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						electronic commerce; electronic publishing; digital content; information goods; Internet service providers (ISP); pricing content; industrial organization; spatial competition; industry structure	COMPETITION	Rapid technological developments and deregulation of the telecommunications industry have changed the way in which content providers distribute and price their goods and services. Instead of selling a bundle of content and access through proprietary networks, these firms are shifting their distribution channels to the Internet. In this new setting, the content and Internet service providers find themselves in a relationship that is simultaneously cooperative and competitive. We find that proprietary content providers prefer the Internet channels to direct channels only if the access market is sufficiently competitive. Furthermore, maintaining a direct channel in addition to the Internet channels changes the equilibrium enough that the proprietary content providers prefer having the Internet channels, regardless of the level of competition in the access market. Telecommunications technology developments uniformly increase content providers' profit. On the other hand, the technology impact on Internet service provider profits is nonmonotonic: Their profits may increase or decrease as a result of lower telecommunication costs. While initially the ISP profit increases as more customers are drawn to the Internet, it eventually decreases as the spatial competition becomes more intense. We also show that proprietary content providers should benefit from having some free content available at the Internet service providers' sites to induce more customers to join the Internet.

Based on a broadened concept of the competitive information technology (IT) market, we develop a dynamic market growth model that is able to incorporate both interproduct category and technological substitution effects simultaneously. The market potential for each category or generation is treated as a variable rather than a constant parameter, which is typical of recently growing IT sectors such as wireless telecommunications. The model is calibrated, its plausibility discussed, and its face and predictive validity assessed using data on wireless telecommunications services from two Asian markets. Results show that the market potential (and sales growth) of one category or generation is significantly affected by others and by the overall structure of a geographic market.

J	Anderson, MC; Banker, RD; Ravindran, S				Anderson, MC; Banker, RD; Ravindran, S			Executive compensation in the information technology industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information technology industry; executive compensation; stock options; pay for performance	AGENCY COSTS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MORAL HAZARD; PAY; HYPOTHESIS; INNOVATION; INCENTIVES; CONTRACTS; OWNERSHIP; MARKET	An innovative business practice attributed to the information technology (IT) industry is the aggressive use of employee stock options to compensate executives and other employees. In this study, we investigate whether the greater use of stock options in the IT industry can be explained on the basis of general economic relationships that apply to firms in all industries. To examine differences in compensating top executives, we estimate a system of simultaneous equations that is designed to accommodate interconnections between performance, the level of compensation, and the mix of compensation components. We document that the shares of both bonus and option pay increase with performance and that the pay level and the extent of incentive pay positively affect firm performance. We identify economic factors that may influence the use of options and show that there are significant differences in these factors between IT and other industries. We find that, while much of the greater use of options by IT firms is explained by the economic factors, significant residual differences remain. We also find that, when performance and other factors are considered, the level of executive pay in the IT industry is not higher than in other industries.

We estimate an intercountry production function relating IT and non-IT inputs to GDP output, on panel data from 36 countries over the 1985-1993 period. We find significant differences between developed and developing countries with respect to their structure of returns from capital investments. For the developed countries in the sample, returns from IT capital investments are estimated to be positive and significant, while returns from non-IT capital investments are not commensurate with relative factor shares. The situation is reversed for the developing countries subsample, where returns from non-IT capital are quite substantial, but those from IT capital investments are not statistically significant. We estimate output growth contributions of IT and non-IT capital and discuss the contrasting policy implications for capital investment by developed and developing economies.

A comparison of Internet and conventional retailers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						search; competition; Internet; price dispersion; menu costs; pricing; intermediaries	EQUILIBRIUM PRICE DISPERSION; PRODUCT QUALITY; CONSUMER SEARCH; MODEL	here have been many claims that the Internet represents a new nearly "frictionless market." Our research empirically analyzes the characteristics of the Internet as a channel for two categories of homogeneous products-books and CDs. Using a data set of over 8,500 price observations collected over a period of 15 months, we compare pricing behavior at 41 Internet and conventional retail outlets. We find that prices on the Internet are 9-16% lower than prices in conventional outlets, depending on whether taxes, shipping, and shopping costs are included in the price. Additionally, we find that Internet retailers' price adjustments over time are up to 100 times smaller than conventional retailers' price adjustments-presumably reflecting lower menu costs in Internet channels. We also find that levels of price dispersion depend importantly on the measures employed. When we compare the prices posted by different Internet retailers we find substantial dispersion. Internet retailer prices differ by an average of 33% for books and 25% for CDs. However, when we weight these prices by proxies for market share, we find dispersion is lower in Internet channels than in conventional channels, reflecting the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers. We conclude that while there is lower friction in many dimensions of Internet competition, branding, awareness, and trust remain important sources of heterogeneity among Internet retailers.

J	Kelly, F; Steinberg, R				Kelly, F; Steinberg, R			A combinatorial auction with multiple winners for universal service	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auctions; combinatorial bidding; universal service; carrier of last resort; telecommunications; synergies	ALLOCATION	We describe a discrete-time auction procedure called PAUSE (Progressive Adaptive User Selection Environment) for use in assigning COLR (Carrier of Last Resort) responsibility for universal service. The auction incorporates synergies by permitting all combinatorial bids, is transparent to the bidders, allows for multiple winners, and minimizes the possibility of bidder collusion. The procedure is computationally tractable for the auctioneer and thus very efficient to run. The inherent computational complexity of combinatorial bidding cannot be eliminated. However, in this auction the computational burden of evaluating synergies rests with the bidders claiming those synergies, while the auctioneer simply checks that a bid is valid.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						illicit drug use; demand central; nonlinear dynamic systems; Hopf-bifurications; optimal control; public policy	COCAINE	Drug use and related problems change substantially over time, so it seems plausible that drug interventions should vary too. To investigate this possibility, we set up a continuous time version of the first-order difference equation model of cocaine use introduced by Everingham and Rydell (1994), extended to make initiation an endogenous function of prevalence. We then formulate and solve drug treatment and prevention spending decisions in the framework of dynamic optimal control under different assumptions about how freely drug control budgets can be manipulated. Insights include: (1) The effectiveness of prevention and treatment depend critically on the stage in the epidemic in which they are employed. Prevention is most appropriate when there are relatively few heavy users, e.g. in the beginning of an epidemic. Treatment is more effective later. (2) Hence, the optimal mix of interventions varies over time. (3) The transition period when it is optimal to use extensively both prevention and treatment is brief. (4) Total social costs increase dramatically if control is delayed.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						sales promotions; coupons; loyalty programs; marketing mix; competetive strategy	BRAND CHOICE; VARIETY-SEEKING; PACKAGE COUPONS; BEHAVIOR; CONSUMERS; INERTIA	We examine the key factors that influence a firm's decision whether to use front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage. The data in both studies are consistent with the model predictions.

J	Park, K; Lee, K; Park, S; Lee, H				Park, K; Lee, K; Park, S; Lee, H			Telecommunication node clustering with node compatibility and network survivability requirements	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						network design; clustering; column generation; branch-and-cut	EQUIPARTITION POLYTOPE; DESIGN; FACETS; CONFIGURATIONS; ALGORITHM; LOCATION	We consider the node clustering problem that arises in designing a survivable two-level telecommunication network. The problem simultaneously determines an optimal partitioning of the whole network into clusters (local networks) and hub locations in each cluster. Intercluster traffic minimization is chosen as the clustering criterion to improve the service quality. Various constraints on the clustering are considered which reflect both the physical structures of local networks, such as the connectivity requirement, and the node compatibility relations such as community of interest or policy. Additional constraints may be imposed on the hub selection to ensure network survivability. We propose an integer programming formulation of the problem by decomposing the entire problem into a master problem and a number of column generation problems. The master problem is solved by column generation and the column generation problems by branch-and-cut. We develop and use strong cutting-planes for the cluster generation subproblems. Computational results using real data are reported.

Customers, whose reservation price distribution changes over time, arrive according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. We show that at any given time, the optimal price decreases with inventory. We also identify a sufficient condition under which the optimal price decreases over time for a given inventory level. This sufficient condition requires that the willingness of a customer to pay a premium for the product does not increase over time. In addition to shedding managerial insight, these structural properties enable efficient computation of the optimal policy. Numerical studies are conducted to show the revenue impact of dynamic price policies. Price changes are set to compensate for statistical fluctuations of demand and to respond to shifts of the reservation price. For the former, our examples show that using optimal dynamic optimal policies achieves 2.4-7.3% revenue improvement over the optimal single price policy. For the latter, the revenue increase can be as high as 100%. These results explain why yield management has become so essential to fashion retailing and travel service industries.

J	Hazen, G				Hazen, G			Preference factoring for stochastic trees	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						expected utility; medical decision making; stochastic trees; multiattribute utility; time preference; quality-adjusted lifetime	RISK UTILITY-ASSESSMENT; TOTAL HIP-REPLACEMENT; DECISION	Stochastic trees are extensions of decision trees that facilitate the modeling of temporal uncertainties. Their primary application has been to medical treatment decisions. It is often convenient to present stochastic trees in factored form, allowing loosely coupled pieces of the model to be formulated and presented separately. Ln this paper, we show how the notion of factoring can be extended as well to preference components of the stochastic model. We examine updateable-state utility, a flexible class of expected utility models that permit stochastic trees to be rolled back much in the manner of decision trees. We show that preference summaries for updateable-state utility can be factored out of the stochastic tree. In addition, we examine utility decompositions which can arise when factors in a stochastic tree are treated as attributes in a multiattribute utility function.

J	Schweitzer, ME; Cachon, GP				Schweitzer, ME; Cachon, GP			Decision bias in the newsvendor problem with a known demand distribution: Experimental evidence	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						behavioral operations; newsvendor inventory decisions; decision bias; anchoring; minimizing ex-post inventory error	UNCERTAINTY; RISK; FEEDBACK	In the newsvendor problem a decision maker orders inventory before a one period selling season with stochastic demand. If too much is ordered, stock is left over at the end of the period, whereas if too little is ordered, sales are lost. The expected profit-maximizing order quantity is well known, but little is known about how managers actually make these decisions. We describe two experiments that investigate newsvendor decisions across different profit conditions. Results from these studies demonstrate that choices systematically deviate from these that maximize expected profit. Subjects order too few of high-profit products and too many of low-profit products. These results are not consistent with risk-aversion, risk-seeking preferences, Prospect Theory preferences, waste aversion, stockout aversion, or the consequences of underestimating opportunity costs. Two explanations are consistent with the data. One, subjects behave as if their utility function incorporates a preference to reduce ex-post inventory error, the absolute difference between the chosen quantity and realized demand. Two, subjects suffer from the anchoring and insufficient adjustment bias. Feedback and training did not mitigate inventory order errors. We suggest techniques to improve decision making.

J	Doerr, KH; Klastorin, TD; Magazine, MJ				Doerr, KH; Klastorin, TD; Magazine, MJ			Synchronous unpaced flow lines with worker differences and overtime cost	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						assembly lines; overtime; individual differences; stochastic line balancing	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY	In this paper, we consider the design of a synchronous, unpaced how line where workers operate at different skill levels and overtime is used, if necessary, to meet a daily production quota. The line is unpaced in the sense that items only move to the next workstation when all workers on the line have completed their respective tasks. The design problem in this case is to assign both workers and tasks to workstations to minimize the expected sum of regular and overtime costs. To solve this problem, we develop an optimization algorithm for smaller problems and a heuristic algorithm for larger problems, which we use to investigate the sensitivity of total expected cost to changes in the price of overtime, hiring practices, worker differences, and the overall amount of work time variability. Based on an extensive computational analysis, we found that (1) planned overtime is frequently beneficial, (2) more workers should be hired as worker variability increases, and (3) increases in overtime costs frequently yield a relatively lower percentage increase in total expected cost. Other managerial implications are discussed in the paper.

Our model includes two of the factors commonly assumed to cause the bullwhip effect: demand forecasting and order lead times. We extend these results to multiple-stage supply chains with and without centralized customer demand information and demonstrate that the bullwhip effect can be reduced, but not completely eliminated, by centralizing demand information.

Various functional forms for such incentive schemes have been proposed, but a critical assumption always made is that the supplier has full information about the buyer's cost structure. We derive the optimal quantity discount policy under asymmetric information and compare it to the situation where the supplier has full information.

It focuses on project-level mechanisms for the generation of knowledge through experimentation and for its accumulation through individual experience. It proposes a model that links these mechanisms to effectiveness in the management of revolutionary and evolutionary development approaches. This argument is tested with data describing projects conducted by all major competitors in the semiconductor industry. Each project was aimed at a technological transition, defined as the introduction of a major new generation of process technology. The analysis shows substantial differences among competitors in the approach taken (i.e., evolutionary vs. revolutionary) and results achieved. Additionally, it shows that individual organizations can migrate, over time, from evolution to revolution and vice versa. The analysis further indicates that accumulating experience and generating knowledge through experimentation are significantly associated with project performance. While product performance improvement through revolution is associated with research experience and with parallel experimentation capacity, improvement through evolution is associated with project experience and minimum experimental iteration time.

J	Venkatesh, V; Davis, FD				Venkatesh, V; Davis, FD			A theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model: Four longitudinal field studies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						adoption of information technology; Technology Acceptance Model; social influence; perceived usefulness	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; USER ACCEPTANCE; PERCEIVED EASE; ORGANIZATIONS; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; DESIGN; USAGE; TASK	The present research develops and tests a theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that explains perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence and cognitive instrumental processes. The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested using longitudinal data collected regarding four different systems at four organizations (N = 156), two involving voluntary usage and two involving mandatory usage. Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40%-60% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34%-52% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance. These findings advance theory and contribute to the foundation for future research aimed at improving our understanding of user adoption behavior.

J	Arya, A; Fellingham, J; Glover, J; Sivaramakrishnan, K				Arya, A; Fellingham, J; Glover, J; Sivaramakrishnan, K			Capital budgeting, the hold-up problem, and information system design	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capital budgeting; hold-up problem; slack	ORGANIZATIONAL SLACK; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; INVESTMENT; RESPONSIBILITY; RENEGOTIATION; INCENTIVES; DECISION; AGENCY; MODEL; COSTS	In this article, we explore the connection between information system design and incentives for project search. The choice of an information system affects the level of managerial slack that is generated during project implementation. Whether slack is beneficial or costly to an organization has been the subject of debate. Ln our model of the hold-up problem in capital budgeting, there are both costs and benefits to having managerial slack. The cost of slack is the consumption of perquisites by the manager. The benefit of slack is that it can serve as a motivational tool. The possibility of increasing his slack may encourage a self-interested manager to conduct a more diligent search for a profitable project. To trade off the costs and benefits of slack in our model, an optimal information system sometimes incorporates coarse information, late information, and a mix of monitored and self-reported information. These features are familiar to accountants. Accounting incorporates both verified (monitored) and unverified (self-reported) information and provides information that is aggregated (coarse) and historical (late).

J	Cetinkaya, S; Lee, CY				Cetinkaya, S; Lee, CY			Stock replenishment and shipment scheduling for vendor-managed inventory systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						vendor-managed inventory; freight consolidation; renewal theory	TRANSPORTATION COSTS; ECONOMIC LOT; MODEL; CONSOLIDATION; STRATEGIES; QUANTITY; DEMAND	Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a supply-chain initiative where the supplier is authorized to manage inventories of agreed-upon stock-keeping units at retail. locations. The benefits of VMI are well recognized by successful retail businesses such as Wal-Mart. In VMI, distortion of demand information (known as bullwhip effect) transferred from the downstream supply-chain member (e.g., retailer) to the upstream member (e.g., supplier) is minimized, stockout situations ape less frequent, and inventory-carrying costs are reduced. Furthermore, a VMI supplier has the liberty of controlling the downstream resupply decisions rather than filling orders as they are placed. Thus, the approach offers a framework for synchronizing inventory and transportation decisions. In this paper, we present an analytical model for coordinating inventory and transportation decisions in VMI systems. Although the coordination of inventory and transportation has been addressed in the literature, our particular problem has not been explored previously. Specifically, we consider a vendor realizing a sequence of random demands from a group of retailers located in a given geographical region. ideally, these demands should be shipped immediately. However, the vendor has the autonomy of holding small orders until an agreeable dispatch time with the expectation that an economical consolidated dispatch quantity accumulates. As a result, the actual inventory requirements at the vendor are partly dictated by the parameters of the shipment-release policy in use. We compute the optimum replenishment quantity and dispatch frequency simultaneously. We develop a renewal-theoretic model for the case of Poisson demands, and present analytical results.

J	Karni, E; Mongin, P				Karni, E; Mongin, P			On the determination of subjective probability by choices	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						subjective probability; subjective expected utility; state-dependent utility	STATE-DEPENDENT UTILITIES; PREFERENCES	The paper explores the uniqueness properties of the subjective probabilities in two axiomatizations of state-dependent preferences Karni, Schmeidler, and Vind's (KSV 1983) system depends on selecting an arbitrary auxiliary probability, and as such, does not guarantee the uniqueness of the derived subjective probability. However, an axiom system initially designed by Karni and Schmeidler (KS 1981) and further elaborated upon here does guarantee the desired uniqueness as well as a useful property of "stability" of the derived solution. When the preference relation displays state-independence, even the KS probabilities may not agree with those derived from the classic Anscombe-Aumann (AA 1963) theorem. However, we claim that, in this case, the KS rather than the AA probabilities are the appropriate representation of the agent's beliefs.

J	Cooper, LG; Giuffrida, G				Cooper, LG; Giuffrida, G			Turning datamining into a management science tool: New algorithms and empirical results	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						datamining; rule generators; residual analysis; promotion event forecasting		This article develops and illustrates a new knowledge discovery algorithm tailored to the action requirements of management science applications. The challenge is to develop tactical planning forecasts at the SKU level. We use a traditional market-response model to extract information from continuous variables and use datamining techniques on the residuals to extract information from the many-valued nominal variables, such as the manufacturer or merchandise category. This combination means that a more complete array of information can be used to develop tactical planning forecasts. The method is illustrated using records of the aggregate sales during promotion events conducted by a 95-store retail chain in a single trading area. In a longitudinal cross validation, the statistical forecast (PromoCast(TM)) predicted the exact number of cases of merchandise needed in 49% of the promotion events and was within +/- one case in 82% of the events. The dataminer developed rules from an independent sample of 1.6 million observations and applied these rules to almost 460,000 promotion events in the validation process. The dataminer had sufficient confidence to make recommendations on 46% of these forecasts. In 66% of those recommendations, the dataminer indicated that the forecast should not be changed. In 96% of those promotion events where "no change" was recommended, this was the correct "action" to take. Even including these "no change" recommendations, the dataminer decreased the case error by 9% across all promotion events in which rules applied.

J	Carrillo, JE; Gaimon, C				Carrillo, JE; Gaimon, C			Improving manufacturing performance through process change and knowledge creation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process change; knowledge management; optimal control theory	LEARNING-CURVE; SYSTEMS; IMPROVEMENT; QUALITY; LAGS	A model is introduced to guide a profit maximizing firm in its quest to enhance performance through process change. The key benefit sought from process change is a long term increase in effective capacity. However, realizing success from process change is not trivial. First, while process change may increase effective capacity in the long run, the disruptions during implementation typically reduce short term capacity. Second, competitive forces such as decreasing revenue streams and shrinking product life cycles complicate the implementation of process change. Third, while knowledge may enhance the ultimate benefits derived from process change, the correct timing and means of knowledge creation are difficult to discern. Lastly, a variety of trade-offs must be evaluated when selecting the particular process change to pursue. For example, choices range from hardware and software replacements to modification of manufacturing procedures. The model introduced here explicitly considers both the short term loss due to disruption and the long term gain in effective capacity associated with the process change. In addition, investments in the accumulation of knowledge are investigated for their potential to enhance process change effectiveness. Knowledge is generated from investment in preparation and training (learning-before-doing) and as a by-product of process change (learning-by-doing). Analysis of the model provides managerial recommendations for several key decisions relating to process change implementation including: (i) the selection of an appropriate process change alternative, (ii) the rate and timing for investment in process change, and (iii) the rate and timing for investment in preparation and training. New results are reported reflecting the important relationship between process change and knowledge. For example, we show that under certain conditions, a firm should optimally delay investment in process change until sufficient accumulation of knowledge is achieved. More generally, we identify conditions whereby investment in process change occurs at an increasing rate over time. This result is particularly important since it demonstrates a limitation of the existing literature where process change always occurs at a decreasing rate.

This rather surprising result reveals the importance of lower partial risk models in portfolio analysis. In this paper, we extend the results of Ogryczak and Ruszczynski for second degree stochastic dominance to third degree stochastic dominance. We show that portfolios on a significant portion of the efficient frontier generated by mean-lower semi-skewness model are efficient in the sense of third degree stochastic dominance. Also, we prove that the portfolios generated by mean-variance-skewness model are semi-efficient in the sense of third degree stochastic dominance.

The population correlation structure among 2KP coefficients, the level of constraint slackness, and the type of correlation (product moment or rank) are varied in this study. Representative branch-and-bound and heuristic solution procedures are used to investigate the influence of these problem parameters on solution procedure performance. Population correlation structure, and in particular the interconstraint component of the correlation structure, is found to be a significant factor influencing the performance of both the algorithm and the heuristic. In addition, the interaction between constraint slackness and population correlation structure is found to influence solution procedure performance.

J	Stadtler, H				Stadtler, H			Improved rolling schedules for the dynamic single-level lot-sizing problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lot-sizing; rolling schedules; planning horizon	FORECAST HORIZONS; MODEL; ALGORITHM; TIME; N)	A major argument for favoring simple lot-sizing heuristics-like the Silver/Meal or Groff's heuristic-to solve instances of the dynamic single-level uncapacitated lot-sizing problem (SLLSP) instead of exact algorithms-like those of Wagner/Whitin or Federgruen/Tzur-is that exact algorithms applied in a rolling horizon environment are heuristics too and may be outperformed by simple heuristics. This article shows how to modify the model of the SLLSP by looking beyond the planning horizon. Extensive tests within a rolling horizon environment have demonstrated that the modified model solved by an exact algorithm now performs at least as well as well-known heuristics and is fairly insensitive to the length of the planning horizon. Furthermore, our principal idea of improving rolling schedules by considering only a portion of the fixed cost related to a decision with an impact on periods beyond the planning horizon is applicable to a wide range of decision models.

J	Chen, KD; Hausman, WH				Chen, KD; Hausman, WH			Technical note: Mathematical properties of the optimal product line selection problem using choice-based conjoint analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; multinomial logit model; choice-based conjoint analysis; independence of irrelevant alternatives; totally unimodular binary integer program; optimal product line selection	HEURISTICS; DESIGN; MODELS	Selecting and pricing product lines is an essential activity in many businesses, in recent years, quantitative approaches for such tasks have been gaining in popularity. One often-employed method is to use data from traditional rankings/ratings-based conjoint analysis and attack the product line selection problem with enumeration or heuristics. In this note, we employ a relatively new methodology known as choice-based conjoint analysis (to model customer preferences) and investigate its mathematical properties when used to model the product line selection problem. Despite some inherent limitations resulting from its aggregated formulation, we show that this more parsimonious conjoint approach has some special mathematical properties that lead to an efficient optimal algorithm to tackle the product line/price selection problem. As a result, problems of realistic size can be solved efficiently using standard, commercially available mathematical programming codes.

J	Harstad, RM; Rothkopf, MH				Harstad, RM; Rothkopf, MH			An "alternating recognition" model of English auctions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						competitive bidding; oral auctions; auction theory; information disclosure in auctions	COMMON-VALUE AUCTIONS	We present an alternative abstraction of an English (oral ascending) auction to the standard, in Milgrom and Weber (1982), that accords more closely with practices in some auction markets. In particular, the assumptions that exits are irrevocable and necessarily public are dropped, making endogenous the decision to compete silently and privately, or openly. In the model, the price rises in a stylization of an auctioneer alternately recognizing two bidders who affirm willingness to pay the current price. The auctioneer pays attention to other bidders only when a recognized bidder exits. Such exits may be temporary, although we construct an equilibrium in which there is no benefit to exit and reentry. The number of public exits is stochastic; frequently a losing "bidder" will remain silent, giving no indication of his willingness to pay, and hence yielding no useful inference about his private information. Thus, the source of the expected revenue advantage of English auctions over second-price auctions is only stochastically available. Moreover, when public exits are incomplete, the ordinal rank of the bidder whose private information can be inferred is unknown, making that information less valuable. Consequently, the Simpler formula for expected revenue in second-price auctions may be the preferred approximation for English auctions.

J	Russo, JE; Meloy, MG; Wilks, TJ				Russo, JE; Meloy, MG; Wilks, TJ			Predecisional distortion of information by auditors and salespersons	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision making; accountability; bias in judgments	MULTIATTRIBUTE BINARY CHOICE; DECISION-MAKING; PRODUCT INFORMATION; ACCOUNTABILITY; JUDGMENTS; HEURISTICS; STANDARDS; BIAS	As people are deciding between two alternatives, they may distort new information to support whichever alternative is tentatively preferred. The presence of such predecisional distortion of information was tested in decisions made by two groups of professionals, auditors and salespersons. Both groups exhibited substantial distortion of information, with Little reduction for professional decisions compared to nonprofessional ones. However, auditors' distortion was significantly smaller than that of salespersons. In addition, holding professionals accountable for their decisions, akin to a supervisory review, lowered distortion somewhat for salespersons but not at all for auditors. The latter seemed to act as if they were always being held accountable. Because people seem unaware that they are distorting information, at least at the moment this bias is occurring, they are fully convinced of the soundness of their choices. This may make it difficult for distortion to be detected by decision makers themselves or even by supervisors who cannot completely duplicate their subordinate's knowledge.

Sources of cost reduction in a large specialty chemicals producer	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational learning; learning curves; process innovations	LEARNING-CURVE; COMPETITION; INDUSTRIAL; KNOWLEDGE; SIZE	Conventional learning curves relating unit cost to measures of production experience are estimated for 221 specialty chemicals produced by a Fortune 500 company. Detailed records on cost and R&D coupled with insights from company personnel are used to explain the variation across products in the rate of cost reduction. Products that exhibited the strongest relationship between unit cost and measures of production experience were subject to specific initiatives, particularly process R&D. The R&D was not, however, generally motivated or informed, by production experience. However, cumulative past output, the most commonly used measure of production experience, was related to expected future output, which conditioned the expected future returns from R&D and the choice of R&D projects. Thus, cumulative output was connected to unit costs through its role in conditioning incentives to undertake process R&D rather than as a proxy for production experience. This suggests that the strong relationship commonly found between unit cost and measures of production experience may reflect incentives to reduce cost as much as learning from production experience.

J	Das, SR; Sundaram, RK				Das, SR; Sundaram, RK			A discrete-time approach to arbitrage-free pricing of credit derivatives	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						credit risk; derivatives; no-arbitage	CORPORATE-DEBT; INTEREST-RATES; RISK; SUBJECT	This paper develops a framework for modelling risky debt and valuing credit derivatives that is flexible and simple to implement, and that is, to the maximum extent possible, based on observables. Our approach is based on expanding the Heath-Jarrow-Morton term-structure model to allow for defaultable debt. Rather than follow the procedure of implying out the behavior of spreads from assumptions concerning the default process, we work directly with the evolution of spreads. The risk-neutral drifts in the resulting model possess a recursive representation that facilitates implementation and makes it possible to handle path-dependence and early exercise features without difficulty. The framework permits embedding a variety of specifications for default; we present an empirical example of a default structure which provides promising calibration results.

J	Lehner, JM				Lehner, JM			Shifts of reference points for framing of strategic decisions and changing risk-return associations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						framing; risk; strategic management	PARADOX LOST; PROSPECT-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSIFICATION; STATES; MARKET; MODEL	Previous results on nonlinear risk-return associations, predicted by prospect theory, are replicated with mean quadratic differences instead of variance as a measure of risk. In contrast to assumptions of these studies, results with a sample from the COMPUSTAT-database provide evidence that at least a minority of firms shift to individual reference levels, which are represented here through levels of minimal risk. Further, changes of environmental conditions as an alternative explanation for switching risk-return relationships are tested against prospect theory predictions. It is shown that risk-return relationships remain stable as long as the relative position to the individual reference level is stable. This explains switching risk-return relationships better than changing environmental conditions.

J	Ha, AY				Ha, AY			Stock rationing in an M/E-k/1 make-to-stock queue	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; inventory rationing; dynamic programming/optimal control; applications	PRODUCTION SYSTEM; COMPONENT COMMONALITY; INVENTORY MODEL; DEMAND CLASSES; SAFETY STOCK; LOST SALES; POLICIES	This paper considers the stock rationing problem of a single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. When demand is Poisson and processing time has an Erlang distribution, we show that a single-state variable called work storage level can be employed to completely capture the information regarding inventory level and the status of current production. The optimal rationing policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone critical work storage levels. For each demand class, there exists a work storage level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher-priority demands. The optimal production policy can also be characterized by a critical work storage level. Our numerical examples indicate that a critical stock level policy, which ignores information on the status of current production, performs very well.

J	Fischer, GW; Luce, MF; Jia, JM				Fischer, GW; Luce, MF; Jia, JM			Attribute conflict and preference uncertainty: Effects on judgment time and error	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							CHOICE; REGRET	This research investigates preference uncertainty generated as a function of specific alternative characteristics during multiattribute evaluative judgments. We propose that preference uncertainty has at least two behavioral manifestations: longer judgment times and greater response error in expressed preferences. We investigate two hypotheses regarding stimulus-based causes of preference uncertainty. As predicted by our attribute conflict hypothesis, greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an evaluative alternative) led to longer judgment times and greater response error. As predicted by our attribute extremity hypothesis, greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) resulted in shorter judgment times and less response error. We also found that judgment times and response errors were strongly positively correlated at the item level, consistent with our assumption that preference uncertainty generated by stimulus characteristics is manifested in judgment time and error. Finally, we found that the item-level preference uncertainty effects proposed here operate in parallel with strategy-level, effort-accuracy tradeoffs observable across participants. These findings are consistent with the RandMAU random multiattribute utility model developed in a companion article by Fischer et al. (2000).

J	Roundy, RO; Muckstadt, JA				Roundy, RO; Muckstadt, JA			Heuristic computation of periodic-review base stock inventory policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic inventory systems; base stock policies; approximations	SYSTEM	We study the problem of determining production quantities in each period of an infinite horizon for a single item produced in a capacity-limited facility. The demand for the product is random, and it is independent and identically distributed from period to period. The demand is observed at the beginning of a time period, but it need not be filled until the end of the period. Unfilled demand is backordered. A base stock or order-up-to policy is used. The shortfall is the order-up-to level minus the inventory position. The inventory system is easily understood and managed if we know the distribution of the shortfall. We develop a new approximation for this distribution, and perform extensive computational tests of existing approximations. Our new approximation works extremely well as long as the coefficient of variation of the demand is less than two. Far practical applications this is by far the most interesting case; No known approximations work well consistently when the coefficient of variation of the demand is greater than two.

J	Mackenzie, KD				Mackenzie, KD			Processes and their frameworks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process; process frameworks; tasks	DECISION	A process is a time-dependent sequence of events governed by a process framework. A group process has five components: the entities performing the process, the steps or elements of a process, the relationship between any pair of elements, the links to other processes, and the resources and their characteristics-in-use involved with the elements. A process framework is denoted by Y = F(C) where Y is the set of outcomes or consequences of a process, C is the set of considerations or elements in the process, and F is the network linking the considerations to each other and to the outcomes. The properties of the set of considerations, the linkages between pairs of consequences, the set of outcomes or consequences, the network, F, and the use of process frameworks are discussed in detail with examples. Process models are compared to variable models.	Univ Kansas, Sch Business, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA	Mackenzie, KD (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Sch Business, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.

Among them, the message routing problem plays a determinant role in the optimization of network performance. Much of the motivation for this work comes from this problem which is shown to belong to the class of nonlinear convex multicommodity flow problems. This paper emphasizes the message routing problem in data networks, but it includes a broader literature overview of convex multicommodity flow problems. We present and discuss the main solution techniques proposed for solving this class of large-scale convex optimization problems. We conduct some numerical experiments on the message routing problem with four different techniques.

J	Wolfe, WJ; Sorensen, SE				Wolfe, WJ; Sorensen, SE			Three scheduling algorithms applied to the earth observing systems domain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						scheduling; algorithms; genetic		This paper describes three approaches to assigning tasks to earth observing satellites (EOS). A fast and simple priority dispatch method is described and shown to produce acceptable schedules most of the time. A look ahead algorithm is then introduced that outperforms the dispatcher by about 12% with only a small increase in run time. These algorithms set the stage for the introduction of a genetic algorithm that uses job permutations as the population. The genetic approach presented here is novel in that it uses two additional binary variables, one to allow the dispatcher to occasionally skip a job in the queue and another to allow the dispatcher to occasionally allocate the worst position to the job. These variables are included in the recombination step in a natural way. The resulting schedules improve on the look ahead by as much as 15% at times and 3% on average. We define and use the "window-constrained packing" problem to model the bare bones of the EOS scheduling problem.

J	Bakos, Y; Brynjolfsson, E				Bakos, Y; Brynjolfsson, E			Bundling information goods: Pricing, profits, and efficiency	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bundling; aggregation; internet; pricing; information goods; digital goods		We study the strategy of bundling a large number of information goods, such as those increasingly available on the Internet, and selling them for a fixed price. We analyze the optimal bundling strategies for a multiproduct monopolist, and we find that bundling very large numbers of unrelated information goods can be surprisingly profitable. The reason is that the law of large numbers makes it much easier to predict consumers' valuations for a bundle of goods than their valuations for the individual goods when sold separately. As a result, this "predictive value of bundling" makes it possible to achieve greater sales, greater economic efficiency, and greater profits per good from a bundle of information goods than can be attained when the same goods are sold separately. Our main results do not extend to most physical goods, as the marginal costs of production for goods not used by the buyer typically negate any benefits from the predictive value of large-scale bundling. While determining optimal bundling strategies for more than two goods is a notoriously difficult problem, we use statistical techniques to provide strong asymptotic results and bounds on profits for bundles of any arbitrary size. We show how our model can be used to analyze the bundling of complements and substitutes, bundling in the presence of budget constraints, and bundling of goods with various types of correlations and how each of these conditions can lead to limits on optimal bundle size. In particular we find that when different market segments of consumers differ systematically in their valuations for goods, simple bundling will no longer be optimal. However, by offering a menu of different bundles aimed at each market segment, bundling makes traditional price discrimination strategies more powerful by reducing the role of unpredictable idiosyncratic components of valuations. The predictions of our analysis appear to be consistent with empirical observations of the markets for Internet and online content, cable television programming, and copyrighted music.

J	Van Mieghem, JA; Dada, M				Van Mieghem, JA; Dada, M			Price versus production postponement: Capacity and competition	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity; investment; pricing; competition; production; inventory; strategy; demand uncertainty	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; MAINTENANCE; INVENTORIES	This article presents a comparative analysis of possible postponement strategies in a two-stage decision model where firms make three decisions: capacity investment, production (inventory) quantity, and price. Typically, investments are made while the demand curve is uncertain. The strategies differ in the timing of the operational decisions relative to the realization of uncertainty. We show how competition, uncertainty, and the timing of operational decisions influence the strategic investment decision of the firm and its value. In contrast to production postponement, price postponement makes the investment and production (inventory) decisions relatively insensitive to uncertainty. This suggests that managers can make optimal capacity decisions by deterministic reasoning if they have some price flexibility. Under price postponement, additional postponement of production has relatively small incremental value. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to consider flexible ex-post pricing before production postponement reengineering. While more postponement increases firm value, it is counterintuitive that this also makes the optimal capacity decision more sensitive to uncertainty. We highlight the different impact of more timely information, which leads to higher investment and inventories, and of reduced demand uncertainty, which decreases investment and inventories. Our analysis suggests appropriateness conditions for simple make-to-stock and make-to-order strategies. We also present technical sufficiency and uniqueness conditions. Under price postponement, these results extend to oligopolistic and perfect competition for which pure equilibria are derived. Interestingly, the relative value of operational postponement techniques seems to increase as the industry becomes more competitive.

J	Krishnan, TV; Bass, FM; Jain, DC				Krishnan, TV; Bass, FM; Jain, DC			Optimal pricing strategy for new products	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						generalized bass model; pricing; optimal strategy; diffusion	DIFFUSION-MODELS; DEMAND	Robinson and Lakhani (1975) initiated a long research stream In marketing when they used the Bass model (1969) to develop optimal pricing path for a new product. A careful analysis of the extant literature reveals that the research predominantly suggests that the optimal price path should be largely based on the sales growth pattern. However, in the real world we rarely find new products that have such pricing pattern. We observe either a monotonically declining pricing pattern or an increase-decrease pricing pattern that does not seem close to the sales path. In this paper, we use a variation of the generalized Bass model (called GEM) developed by Bass et al. (1994) that yields optimal pricing policies that are consistent with empirical data.

J	Schultz, KL; Juran, DC; Boudreau, JW				Schultz, KL; Juran, DC; Boudreau, JW			The effects of low inventory on the development of productivity norms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						group norms; work teams; job design; JIT; cohesiveness; feedback; peer pressure	PERFORMANCE; INTERDEPENDENCE; FEEDBACK	Low inventory, a crucial part of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing systems, enjoys increasing application worldwide, vet the behavioral effects of such systems remain largely unexplored. Operations research (OR) models of low-inventory systems typically use a simplifying assumption that processing times of individual workers are independent random variables. This leads to predictions that low-inventory systems will exhibit production interruptions leading to lower productivity. Yet empirical results suggest that low-inventory systems do not exhibit the predicted productivity losses. This paper develops a model integrating feedback, goal setting, group cohesiveness, task norms, and peer pressure to predict how individual behavior may adjust to alleviate production interruptions in low-inventory systems. In doing so we integrate previous research on the development of task norms. Operations research models are used to show how norms can significantly improve throughput by decreasing variance and increasing the speed of the slowest workers, even if accompanied by decreases in speed of the fastest workers. Findings suggest that low-inventory systems induce individual and group responses that cause behavioral changes that mitigate production interruptions.

Each shipment, either to Stage 2 or to Stage 1, incurs a fixed setup cost. Under the assumption that the supply leadtime at Stage 2 is zero, we characterize a simple heuristic policy whose long-run average cost is guaranteed to be within 6% of optimality, i.e., a 94%-effective policy.

In these methods joint tangents of the decision makers' value functions are searched by adjusting an artificial plane constraint. The problem of generating Pareto-optimal solutions decomposes into ordinary multiple criteria decision-making problems for the individual decision makers and into a coordination problem for an assisting mediator. Depending on the numerical iteration scheme used to solve the coordination problem, different constraint proposal methods are obtained. We analyze and illustrate the behaviour of some iteration schemes by numerical examples using both precise and imprecise answers from decision makers. An example of a method belonging to the class under study is the RAMONA method, that has been previously described from a practical point of view. We present the underlying theory for it by describing it as a constraint proposal method, and include some applications.

Practical databases accommodate users with heterogeneous needs for access. Each class of data user is accorded access to only certain views. Other views are considered confidential, and hence to be protected. Using illustrations from health care and education, this article addresses inferential disclosure of confidential views in multidimensional categorical databases. It demonstrates that any structural, so data-value-independent method for detecting disclosure can fail. Consistent with previous work for two-way tables, it presents a data-value-dependent method to obtain tight lower and upper bounds for confidential data values. For two-dimensional projections of categorical databases, it exploits the network structure of a linear programming (LP) formulation to develop two transportation flow algorithms that are both computationally efficient and insightful. These algorithms can be easily implemented through two new matrix operators, cell-maxima and cell-minima. Collectively, this method is called matrix comparative assignment (MCA). Finally, it extends both the LP and MCA approaches to inferential disclosure when accessible views have been masked.

The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 837 manufacturing companies in a typical middle-income country (Spain), in which firms are starting to internationalize through investments or alliances in distribution. Following theoretical expectations, the greater the level of such ownership factors as intangible technological assets, product variability, and resource availability, the higher the likelihood of internalization, and in particular internalization by proprietary distribution instead of by commercial alliance. But most importantly, location factors in the home country and in the export market have an independent effect on the likelihood and mode of internalization. Proprietary distribution channels are preferred when the firm's competitors are based in richer countries than the home country, and when the export market is well known to the firm.

VDT simulates the micro-level information processing, communication, and coordination behavior of participants in a project organization and predicts several measures of participant and project-level performance. VDT-1 (Cohen 1991) and VDT-2 (Christiansen 1993) modeled project organizations containing actors with perfectly congruent goals engaged in complex but routine engineering design work within static organization structures. VDT-S extends the VDT-2 work process representation to include measures of activity flexibility, complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence strength. It explicitly models the effects of goal incongruency between agents on their information processing and communication behavior while executing more flexible tasks. These extensions allow VDT to model more flexible organizations executing less routine work processes. VDT thus bridges rigorously between cognitive and social psychological micro-organization theory and sociological and economic macro-organization theory for project teams. VDT-3 has been used to model and simulate the design of two major subsystems of a complex satellite launch vehicle. This case study provides initial evidence that the micro-contingency theory embodied in VDT-5 can be used to predict organizational breakdowns, and to evaluate alternative organizational changes to mitigate identified risks.

A retailer must construct an assortment for the category, i.e., select a subset variants to stock and determine purchase quantities for each offered variant. We analyze this problem using a multinomial logit model to describe the consumer choice process and a newsboy model to represent the retailer's inventory cost. We show that the optimal assortment has a simple structure and provide insights on how various factors affect the optimal level of assortment variety. We also develop a formal definition of the level of fashion in a category using the theory of majorization and examine its implications for category profits.

The state variable of the MDP represents the demand state brought about by changing environmental factors as well as promotion decisions. The demand state in a period determines the distribution of the random demand in that period. Optimal inventory and promotion decision policies in the finite horizon problem are obtained via dynamic programming. Under certain conditions, we show that there is a threshold inventory level P for each demand state such that if the threshold is exceeded, then it is desirable to promote the product. For the proportional ordering cost case, the optimal inventory replenishment policy is a base-stock type policy with the optimal base-stock level dependent on the promotion decision.

J	Swamidass, PM; Nair, SS; Mistry, SI				Swamidass, PM; Nair, SS; Mistry, SI			The use of a neural factory to investigate the effect of product line width on manufacturing performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						neural factory; factory model; manufacturing plant model; neural network; neural model of manufacturing; factory focus; product line width	NETWORKS; UNCERTAINTY; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGY; MODEL	The dual goals of this study are: (1) to develop an empirically valid neural model of U.S. factories in a range of industries producing discrete products, and (2) to use the model to test the effect of changes in product line width On plant performance variables. Accordingly, a neural factory was developed using 59 input and 5 output/performance variables, and was trained using field data collected from 385 U.S, manufacturing plants. The model was validated using a holdout sample before conducting sensitivity tests. The study demonstrates that, through the use of parametric sensitivity analysis, the neural factory could be used to investigate the relationship between inputs and performance of a factory. While the focused factory principle would favor a smaller product line, economies of score theory would favor a larger product line for the good of the factory; this implies a rather complex relationship between product line width (PLW) and plant performance. The neural factory was used to study the sensitivity of output/performance variables when product line width was varied over a range extending from 10% to 200% of the average values. The sensitivity analysis of the neural factory shows that, as the product line increases, it (1) does not affect cost-of-goods-sold (COGS), (2) decreases return on investment, (3) has a negative effect on the top management's perception of manufacturing performance, (4) increases inventory turns, and (5) increases sales per employee. The explanations for these findings show how complex and intertwined the relationships between PLW and performance variables are. They enhance our understanding of PLW and provide some new directions for future empirical research.

In this paper the DC algorithm is applied to determining exact or approximate global minima of supermodular functions. The working of the algorithm is illustrated by an instance of the Simple Plant Location (SPL) Problem. Computational results, obtained for the Quadratic Cost Partition Problem (QCP), show that the DC algorithm outperforms a branch-and-cut algorithm, not only for sparse graphs but also for nonsparse graphs (with density more than 40%), often with speeds 100 times faster.

J	Kleinman, NL; Spall, JC; Naiman, DQ				Kleinman, NL; Spall, JC; Naiman, DQ			Simulation-based optimization with stochastic approximation using common random numbers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Common Random Numbers; Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA); Finite Difference Stochastic Approximation (FDSA); discrete event dynamic systems	PERTURBATION GRADIENT APPROXIMATION	The method of Common Random Numbers is a technique used to reduce the variance of difference estimates in simulation optimization problems. These differences are commonly used to estimate gradients of objective functions as part of the process of determining optimal values for parameters of a simulated system. asymptotic results exist which show that using the Common Random Numbers method in the iterative Finite Difference Stochastic Approximation optimization algorithm (FDSA) can increase the optimal rate of convergence of the algorithm from the typical rate of k(-1/3) to the faster k(-1/2), where k is the algorithm's iteration number. Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) is a newer and often much more efficient optimization algorithm, and we will show that this algorithm, too, converges faster when the Common Random Numbers method is used. We will also provide multivariate asymptotic covariance matrices for both the SPSA and FDSA errors.

J	Whitt, W				Whitt, W			Partitioning customers into service groups	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queues; multiserver queues; service systems; service-system design; resource sharing; service systems with express lines	SERVER QUEUE; DISTRIBUTIONS; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM; MODELS	We explore the issues of when and how to partition arriving customers into service groups that will be served separately, in a first-come first-served manner, by multiserver service systems having a provision for waiting, and how to assign an appropriate number of servers to each group. We assume that customers can be classified upon arrival, so that different service groups can have different service-time distributions. We provide methodology for quantifying the tradeoff between economies of scale associated with larger systems and the benefit of having customers with shorter service times separated from other customers with longer service times, as is done in service systems with express lines. To properly quantify this tradeoff, it is important to characterize service-time distributions beyond their means. In particular, it is important to also determine the variance of the service-time distribution of each service group. Assuming Poisson arrival processes, we then can model the congestion experienced by each server group as an M/G/s queue with unlimited waiting room. We use previously developed approximations for M/G/s performance measures to quickly evaluate alternative partitions.

J	Gardner, DT; Rogers, JS				Gardner, DT; Rogers, JS			Planning electric power systems under demand uncertainty with different technology lead times	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						lead time; capacity planning; demand uncertainty; electric power systems	CAPACITY EXPANSION	Demand uncertainty is a key concern of electric utility planners. While the greater use of short lead time technologies provides one possible way to deal with this problem, it is not clear how they are best deployed. The approach taken in this paper is to examine a capacity mix model that explicitly accounts for differences in technology lead times. Key results that are obtained include the characterization of the optimal solution and the development of a new set of technology screening criteria, in practice, the "lead time order" (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending length of lead time) is typically the inverse of the so-called merit order (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending operating cost). We show that for this case, the optimal solution may be determined with relative ease. A numerical example demonstrates that some short lead time technologies screened out by standard planning methods may enter the optimal solution when differences in lead time are considered, while some long lead time technologies may leave. Ln addition, the optimal expected level of reliability may be greater.

J	Drexl, A; Haase, K				Drexl, A; Haase, K			Fast approximation methods for sales force deployment	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing models; sales force sizing; salesman location; sales territory alignment; sales resource allocation; application/distribution of beverages	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; DECISIONS	Sales force deployment involves the simultaneous resolution of four interrelated subproblems: sales force sizing, salesman location, sales territory alignment, and sales resource allocation. The first subproblem deals with selecting the appropriate number of salesman. The salesman location aspect of the problem involves determining the location of each salesman in one sales coverage unit. Sales territory alignment may be viewed as the problem of grouping sales coverage units into larger geographic clusters called sales territories. Sales resource allocation refers to the problem of allocating scarce salesman time to the aligned sales coverage units. All four subproblems have to be resolved in order to maximize Profit of the selling organization. Ln this paper a novel nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is formulated which covers all four subproblems simultaneously. For the solution of the model we present approximation methods capable of solving large-scale, real-world instances. The methods, which provide lower bounds for the optimal objective function value, are benchmarked against upper bounds. On average the solution gap, i.e., the difference between upper and lower bounds, is about 3%. Furthermore, we show how the methods can be used to analyze various problem settings of practical relevance. Finally, an application in the beverage industry is presented.

J	Villas-Boas, JM; Winer, RS				Villas-Boas, JM; Winer, RS			Endogeneity in brand choice models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						endogeneity; brand choice models; panel data; common demand shocks; limited dependent variables	PRICE; SALES; BUY	Applications of random utility models to scanner data have been widely presented in marketing for the last 20 years. One particular problem with these applications is that they have ignored possible correlations between the independent variables in the deterministic component of utility (price, promotion, etc.) and the stochastic component or error term. In fact, marketing-mix variables, such as price, not only affect brand purchasing probabilities but are themselves endogenously set by marketing managers. This work tests whether these endogeneity problems are important enough to warrant consideration when estimating random utility models with scanner panel data. Our results show that not accounting for endogeneity may result in a substantial bias in the parameter estimates.

J	Tsay, AA				Tsay, AA			The quantity flexibility contract and supplier-customer incentives	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; supply contracts; quantity flexibility; coordination; forecasting; forecast revision; materials planning	LONG-TERM-CONTRACTS; RETURNS POLICIES; DECISIONS	Consider a supply chain consisting of two independent agents, a supplier (e.g., a manufacturer) and its customer (e.g., a retailer), the latter in turn serving an uncertain market demand. To reconcile manufacturing/procurement time lags with a need for timely response to the market, such supply chains often must commit resources to production quantities based on forecasted rather than realized demand. The customer typically provides a planning forecast of its intended purchase, which does not entail commitment. Benefiting from overproduction while not bearing the immediate costs, the customer has incentive to initially overforecast before eventually purchasing a lesser quantity. The supplier must in turn anticipate such behavior in its production quantity decision. This individually rational behavior results in an inefficient supply chain. This paper models the incentives of the two parties, identifying causes of inefficiency and suggesting remedies. Particular attention is given to the Quantity Flexibility (QF) contract, which couples the customer's commitment to purchase no less than a certain percentage below the forecast with the supplier's guarantee to deliver up to a certain percentage above. Under certain conditions, this method can allocate the costs of market demand uncertainty so as to lead the individually motivated supplier and customer to the systemwide optimal outcome. We characterize the implications of QF contracts for the behavior and performance of both parties, and the supply chain as a whole.

J	Childs, PD; Triantis, AJ				Childs, PD; Triantis, AJ			Dynamic R&D investment policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						real options; research and development (R&D); project interactions; learning-by-doing; accelerated development	REAL OPTIONS	This paper examines dynamic R&D investment policies and the valuation of R&D programs in a contingent claims framework. We incorporate the following characteristics of R&D programs into our model: learning-by-doing, collateral learning between different projects in the program, interaction between project cash flows, periodic reevaluations of the program, different intensities of investment, capital rationing constraints, and competition. We show that a firm may invest in multiple projects even if only one can be implemented after development is complete. Furthermore, the firm may significantly alter its funding policy over time. For example, it may simultaneously develop multiple projects for a period of time, then focus on a lead project, and potentially resume funding of a "backup" project if the lead project fails to deliver on its early promise. We show how a firm can forecast expected R&D spending through time for an optimally executed R&D program. While project volatility plays an important role in determining R&D program value, we find that for high volatility projects the optimal investment policy is not very sensitive to changes in (or misestimation of) volatility. In considering whether to accelerate development of a project, a firm should balance the adverse effects of increased costs and the loss of investment flexibility against the positive effects of rapid uncertainty resolution and accelerated cash flows. In the presence of a budget constraint that prevents the firm from simultaneously accelerating projects and developing projects in parallel, we find that, if one project significantly dominates another early in the development stage, the option to accelerate the lead project is likely to be more valuable than the option to exchange projects. Thus, the backup project would be shelved in order to commit extra resources to development of the lead project. Finally, competition from other firms leads to more parallel investment in the early development stages of projects, less parallel investment in the latter stages of development, and lower overall investment.

J	Li, CL; Kouvelis, P				Li, CL; Kouvelis, P			Flexible and risk-sharing supply contracts under price uncertainty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply contracts; global operations; flexibility; binomial lattice		We study supply contracts for deterministic demand but in an environment of uncertain prices. We develop valuation methodologies for different types of supply contracts. A "time-inflexible contract" requires the firm to specify not only how many units it will purchase, but also the timing of the purchase. A "time-flexible contract" allows the firm to specify the purchase amount over a given period of time without specifying the exact time of purchase. Other than time flexibility, the suppliers may offer "quantity flexibility" to the firm as well, i.e., purchase quantities could be within a prespecified quantity window. Finally, "risk-sharing" features can be incorporated in the contract in terms of the purchase price that the firm eventually pays to a supplier. Within a prespecified price window the firm pays the realized price, but outside of it the firm shares, in an agreed way, added costs or benefits. Given the structure of a supply contract, we study the firm's decision when to purchase and how many units in each purchase such that the expected net present value of the purchase cost plus inventory holding cost is minimized. We discuss optimal purchasing strategies for both time-flexible and time-inflexible contracts with risk-sharing features. Other interesting results include the analysis of two-supplier sourcing environments and the exploitation of quantity flexibility in such contracts. Our discussion illustrates how time flexibility, quantity flexibility, supplier selection, and risk sharing, when carefully exercised can effectively reduce the sourcing cost in environments of price uncertainty.

J	Muralidhar, K; Parsa, R; Sarathy, R				Muralidhar, K; Parsa, R; Sarathy, R			A general additive data perturbation method for database security	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						database management; data security; data perturbation	STATISTICAL DATABASES	The security of organizational databases has received considerable attention in the literature in recent years. This can be attributed to a simultaneous increase in the amount of data being stored in databases, the analysis of such data, and the desire to protect confidential data. Data perturbation methods are often used to protect confidential, numerical data from unauthorized queries while providing maximum access and accurate information to legitimate queries. To provide accurate information, it is desirable that perturbation does not result in a change in relationships between attributes. In the presence of nonconfidential attributes, existing methods will result in such a change. This study describes a new method (General Additive Data Perturbation) that does not change relationships between attributes. Al existing methods of additive data perturbation are shown to be special cases of this method. When the database has a multivariate normal distribution, the new method provides maximum security and minimum bias. For nonnormal databases, the new method provides better security and bias performance than the multiplicative data perturbation method.

J	Alfredsson, P; Verrijdt, J				Alfredsson, P; Verrijdt, J			Modeling emergency supply flexibility in a two-echelon inventory system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory control; service parts; emergency supply	LATERAL TRANSSHIPMENTS; ITEM	We consider a two-echelon inventory system for service parts. To obtain high service levels at a low cost we allow not only for normal supply of parts but also for emergency supply options in terms of lateral transshipments and direct deliveries. After presenting the strategy we use for satisfying customer demand, we construct an analytical model that we use to calculate relevant performance measures. Simulation shows that our model produces accurate estimates, and that the performance of the inventory system is insensitive to the lead-time distribution. After introducing a cost structure we show that the strategy we propose can result in considerable savings when compared to using only normal supply. Comparison of the results of our model with the results of other models indicates that the combined use of lateral transshipments and direct deliveries can lead to significant cost savings.

A utility function is said to exhibit broad DARA if and only if a rise in wealth always decreases the magnitude of the risk premium for one of the risks vis-a-vis the other. A condition on utility functions giving this property is derived: utility must be of the linear plus exponential form. It is shown that certain problems involving portfolios and risk-averse firms give unambiguous comparative statics if and only if utility exhibits broad DARA.

In this paper, we study a variant of the minimum cost flow problem where we are given a set R subset of or equal to A of arcs and require that each are in R must carry the same amount of flow. This problem, which we call the simple equal flow problem, arose while modeling a water resource system management in Sardinia, Italy. We consider the simple equal flow problem in a directed network with n nodes, m arcs, and where all are capacities and node supplies are integer and bounded by U. We develop several algorithms for the simple equal flow problem - the network simplex algorithm, the parametric simplex algorithm, the combinatorial parametric algorithm, the binary search algorithm, and the capacity scaling algorithm. The binary search algorithm solves the simple equal flow problem in O(log(nU)) applications of any minimum cost flow algorithm. The capacity scaling algorithm solves it in O(m(m + n log n) log (nU)) time, which is almost the same time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem by the capacity scaling algorithm. These algorithms can be easily modified to obtain an integer solution of the simple equal flow problem.

J	Gurnani, H; Tang, CS				Gurnani, H; Tang, CS			Note: Optimal ordering decisions with uncertain cost and demand forecast updating	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; uncertain cost; demand forecast updating		We determine the optimal ordering policy for a retailer who has two instants to order a seasonal product from a manufacturer prior to a single selling season. While the demand is uncertain, the retailer can improve the forecast by utilizing the market signals observed between the first and second instants. However, because of the nature of the manufacturing environment, the unit cost at the second instant is uncertain and could be higher (or lower) than the unit cost at the first instant. To determine the profit-maximizing ordering strategies at both instants, the retailer has to evaluate the trade-off between a more accurate forecast and a potentially higher unit cost at the second instant. We present a nested newsvendor model for determining the optimal order quantity at each instant and characterize the conditions under which it is optimal for the retailer to delay its order until the second instant.

We develop an analytical framework in which profit change between one period and the next is decomposed into three sources: (i) a productivity change effect (which includes a technical change effect and an operating efficiency effect), (ii) an activity effect (which includes a product mix effect, a resource mix effect, and a scale effect), and (iii) a price effect. We then show how to quantify the contribution of each effect, using only observed prices and quantities of products and resources in the two periods. We illustrate our analytical decomposition of profit change with an empirical application to Spanish banking during the period 1987-1994.

We discuss a full Bayesian analysis based on data collected from customers of: a leading financial services company. Our approach allows us to explicitly accommodate missing data and enables quantitative assessment of the impact of the drivers of satisfaction across the customer population. We find that satisfaction with product offerings is a primary driver of overall customer satisfaction, The quality of customer service with respect to financial statements and services provided through different channels of delivery, such as information technology enabled call centers and traditional branch offices, are also important in determining overall satisfaction. However, our analysis indicates that the impact of these service delivery factors may differ substantially across customer segments. In order to facilitate managerial action, we discuss how specific operational quality attributes for designing and delivering financial services can be leveraged to enhance satisfaction with product offerings and service delivery. Our approach and findings have significant implications for managing customer satisfaction in the financial services industry.

There are 11 processes included in this study, which represent the bulk of the activities performed in a typical retail branch (e.g., opening checking accounts). The first finding of this study is that the financial performance of banks that perform be tt er across these processes tend to be better than that of other banks. in addition to the variation in process performance across banks, there is also substantial variation across processes within banks. That is, banks that performed well in one process often performed quite badly in another. We present an analytical model that shows that improvement in process variation can be more important than improvement in aggregate process performance when dealing with certain customer segments. Empirical evidence from the Wharton Financial Institution Center Retail Banking Study of bank holding companies in the United States provides support.

Three models-based on the nonparametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysis-are developed in order to implement the framework in a practical setting: (i) an operational efficiency model, (ii) a service quality efficiency model, and (iii) a profitability efficiency model. The use of the models is illustrated using data from the branches of a commercial bank. Empirical results indicate that we gain superior insights by analyzing simultaneously the design of operations together with the quality of the provided services and profitability, rather than by benchmarking these three dimensions separately. Relationships are also established between operational efficiency and profitability, and between operational efficiency and service quality.

J	Allen, F; Gale, D				Allen, F; Gale, D			Innovations in financial services, relationships, and risk sharing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						markets; intermediaries; unforeseen contingencies; misunderstandings; implicit contracts	VOLATILITY; CHOICE	Relationships between intermediaries and their customers have become increasingly important in recent years. This paper argues that the need for costly ex ante information acquisition and analysis is a major barrier to the participation of investors and firms in sophisticated markets. Long-term relationships between intermediaries and their customers, in which intermediaries provide implicit insurance to customers, can be an effective substitute for costly ex ante investigation. Ln this way, intermediaries allow firms and investors to reap the benefits of financial markets. Relationships are easiest to sustain when the ongoing benefits to both parties are high. As a result, competition may lower the benefits that can be obtained from relationships.

J	Cummins, JD; Weiss, MA; Zi, HM				Cummins, JD; Weiss, MA; Zi, HM			Organizational form and efficiency: The coexistence of stock and mutual property-liability insurers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational form; X-efficiency; data envelopment analysis; insurance	LIFE-INSURANCE INDUSTRY; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR	This article introduces a new approach, cross-frontier analysis, for estimating the relative efficiency of alternative organizational forms in an industry. The technique is illustrated by analyzing a sample of stock and mutual property-liability insurers using nonparametric frontier efficiency methods. Cross-frontier analysis measures the relative efficiency of each organizational form by computing the efficiency of each stock (mutual) firm relative to a reference set consisting of all mutual (stock) firms. We test agency-theoretic hypotheses about organizational form, including the managerial discretion and expense preference hypotheses. The results indicate that stocks and mutuals are opera ting on separate production and cost frontiers and thus represent distinct technologies. Consistent with the managerial discretion hypothesis,the stock technology dominates the mutual technology for producing stock outputs and the mutual technology dominates the stock technology far producing mutual outputs. However, consistent with the expense preference hypothesis, the stock cost frontier dominates the mutual cost frontier. Our findings thus suggest a richer interpretation of organizational form than provided by previous researchers.

J	Seiford, LM; Zhu, J				Seiford, LM; Zhu, J			Profitability and marketability of the top 55 US commercial banks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						data envelopment analysis (DEA); profitability; marketability; efficiency; banks	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; OPERATING EFFICIENCY; SCALE; BRANCHES; RETURNS; MODELS; UNITS; DMUS; DEA	Utilizing recent developments in data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper examines the performance of the top 55 U.S. commercial banks via a two-stage production process that separates profitability and marketability. Substantial performance inefficiency is uncovered in both dimensions. Relatively large banks exhibit better performance on profitability, whereas smaller banks tend to perform better with respect to marketability. New context-dependent performance measures are defined for profitability and marketability which employ a DEA stratification model and a DEA attractiveness measure. When combined with the original DEA measure, the context-dependent performance measure better characterizes the profitability and marketability of 55 U.S. commercial banks. The new approach identifies areas for improved bank performance over the two-stage production process. The effect of acquisition on efficiency and attractiveness is also examined.

J	Marsden, JR; Tung, YA				Marsden, JR; Tung, YA			The use of information system technology to develop tests on insider trading and asymmetric information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information system technology; laboratory experimentation; insider trading; asymmetric information	RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS; MARKET-EFFICIENCY; AGGREGATION; AUCTIONS; REWARDS; COSTS	Issues related to insider trading remain popular research topics. Empirical studies using historical data are Limited by two key factors: 1) the inability to identify exactly who possesses inside information, and 2) the inability to identify the accuracy of information possessed. Advances in information system. technology enable us to overcome these problems in the laboratory. Using this technology, we create a research shell to conduct experiments where we can identify the exact type and quality of information accessible by each trader. Our system includes the capability to monitor individual activities in accessing inside information. The system can automatically impose a monetary penalty if random monitoring identifies a trader accessing inside information. Our experiments involve traders who receive access to inside information without initial knowledge of the quality of that information. The results indicate that traders were able to outperform the market if penalties for being caught accessing such information were not included. Once penalties were included, however, no significant performance differences were observed. Finally, in a second set of experiments involving a simplified market with infrequent electronic monitoring and low penalty amounts, inside information seemed to be rapidly and effectively disseminated to traders possessing no inside information.

FSI (free-standing-insert) data show that coupon duration varies across brands. In this paper, we show how coupon duration can affect coupon profitability. We also provide answers for some empirical observations on coupon duration. We explain, for example, why (i) coupon duration will vary across firms, such that large market share firms will give short-duration coupons and small market share firms will give long-duration coupons; (ii) longer coupon duration for one brand will increase redemption for coupons of that brand and of a competing brand; (iii) coupon duration will affect coupon profitability.

J	Fischer, GW; Carmon, Z; Ariely, D; Zauberman, G				Fischer, GW; Carmon, Z; Ariely, D; Zauberman, G			Goal-based construction of preferences: Task goals and the prominence effect	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multiattribute utility; preference assessment; preference reversals; prominence effect; task goals	CHOICE; REVERSALS; FEATURES	Preferences inferred from choice are more likely to favor the alternative that is superior with respect to the prominent (most important or salient) attribute than are preferences inferred from matching (direct tradeoff) judgments. This prominence effect violates standard models of rational choice and complicates the task of measuring preferences. In this article, we propose a new task-goal hypothesis regarding the prominence effect: The prominent attribute receives more weight in tasks whose goal is to differentiate among options than in tasks whose goal is to equate options. We use this hypothesis to generalize the prominence effect beyond choice and matching to several additional tasks, including the choice-based matching and difference comparison methods that are widely employed in decision analysis. The results of three studies provide strong support for the task-goat account of the prominence effect and cast doubt on competing explanations. We discuss the implications of these findings for descriptive decision theory and for preference measurement in decision analysis, public policy, and marketing.

J	Chen, FG				Chen, FG			Decentralized supply chains subject to information delays	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; information delays; teams; cost centers; incentive compatibility; irrational behavior; the beer game	DISCOUNT PRICING MODEL; INVENTORY; INCENTIVES; SYSTEMS; CHANNEL; PROFITS	We consider a supply chain whose members are divisions of the same firm. The divisions are managed by different individuals with only local inventory information. Both the material and information flows in the supply chain are subject to delays. Under the assumption that the division managers share a common goal to optimize the overall performance of the supply chain (i.e., they act as a team), we characterize the optimal decision rules for the divisions. The team solution reveals the role of information leadtimes in determining the optimal replenishment strategies. We then show that the owner of the firm can manage the divisions as cost centers without compromising the systemwide performance. This is achieved by using an incentive-compatible measurement scheme based on accounting inventory levels. Finally, we investigate the impact of irrational behavior on supply chain performance and demonstrate that it is important for the upstream members of the supply chain to have access to accurate customer demand information.

J	Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA				Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA			Capacity choice and allocation: Strategic behavior and supply chain performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain; game theory; capacity allocation; bull-whip effect; incentive contracts	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; SCHEMES; SALES	We consider a simple supply chain in which a single supplier sells to several downstream retailers. The suppliers has limited capacity, and retailers are privately informed of their optimal stocking levels. If retailer orders exceed available capacity, the supplier allocates capacity using a publicly known allocation mechanism, a mapping from retailer orders to capacity assignments. We show that a broad class of mechanisms are prone to manipulation: Retailers will order more than they need to gain a more favorable allocation. Another class of mechanisms induces the retailers to order exactly their needs, thereby revealing their private information. However, there does not exist a truth-inducing mechanism that maximizes total retailer profits. We also consider the supplier's capacity choice. We show that a manipulable mechanism may lead the supplier to choose a higher level of capacity than she would under a truth-inducing mechanism. Nevertheless, her choice will appear excessively restrictive relative to the prevailing distribution of orders. Furthermore, switching to a truth-inducing mechanism can lower profits for the supplier, the supply chain, and even her retailers. Hence, truth-telling is not a universally desirable goal.

J	Silverman, BS				Silverman, BS			Technological resources and the direction of corporate diversification: Toward an integration of the resource-based view and transaction cost economics	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						diversification; resource-based view; transaction cost economics; patients	FIRM; OPPORTUNITY; SPILLOVERS; PATTERNS; PATENTS	This study considers how a firm's resource base affects the choice of industries into which the firm diversifies. It offers two main extensions of prior research. First, it operationalizes technological resources at a more detailed level than in prior studies, thereby enabling a more stringent analysis of the direction of diversification. This analysis shows that the predictive power of the "resource-based view of the firm" is greatly improved when resources are measured at a finer level. Second, the study integrates principles from transaction cost economics into resource-based predictions concerning diversification. In particular, it tests the common assumption that rent-generating resources are too asset specific to allow contracting. The findings point to circumstances where resources can be and are exploited through contracting rather than through diversification.

Similar analysis is given for the tail probabilities of the accumulated claims during a fixed period. We perform sensitivity analysis with respect to both distributional and structural parameters of the underlying risk model. In the former case, we use the score function method and in the latter, a combination of the push-out method and the score function. We finally show how, from the same sample path, to derive a consistent estimator of the optimal solution in an optimization problem associated with excess-of-loss reinsurance.

J	Ernst, R; Kouvelis, P				Ernst, R; Kouvelis, P			The effects of selling packaged goods on inventory decisions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory with substitution; bundling policies; newsvendor problem; retail inventories; product line design	POLICIES	In this paper, we study within a newsboy type modeling framework the common business practice of retail firms to sell. products not only as independent items, but also as part of multiproduct packets (packaged goods). Our emphasis is on understanding the effects of such practices on the inventory decisions of the firm. We provide insights on the resulting level of suboptimality when inventory decisions are made with demand information only on the independent items and without accounting for the demand substitution structure induced between independent items and packaged goods. Our stylized model studies an environment with two products that are not direct substitutes for each other, sold either independently or as part of a packet that contains one unit of each. We provide necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for this model and suggest an efficient numerical search for obtaining the optimal stocking levels. An extensive computational study allowed us to provide insights on the nature of the optimal stocking policies, the suboptimality of independent newsboy policies, the effects of demand correlation among individual products and multiproduct packets, and the determining role of induced substitution structure among products during stockout occasions on the profitability of the inventory system.

J	Ziarati, K; Soumis, F; Desrosiers, J; Solomon, MM				Ziarati, K; Soumis, F; Desrosiers, J; Solomon, MM			A branch-first, cut-second approach for locomotive assignment	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						integer linear programming; branch and cut; decomposition; scheduling; railway	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; COLUMN GENERATION; TIME WINDOWS; ALGORITHMS	The problem of assigning locomotives to trains consists of selecting the types and number of engines that minimize the fixed and operational locomotive costs resulting from providing sufficient power to pull trains on fixed schedules. The force required to gull a train is often expressed in terms of horsepower and tonnage requirements rather than in terms of number of engines. This complicates the solution process of the integer programming formulation and usually creates a large integrality gap. Furthermore, the solution of the linearly relaxed problem is strongly fractional. To obtain integer solutions, we propose a novel branch-and-cut approach. The core of the method consists of branching decisions that define on one branch the projection of the problem on a low-dimensional subspace. There, the facets of the polyhedron describing a restricted constraint set can be easily derived. We call this approach branch-fil st, cut-second. We first derive facets when at most two types of engines are used. We then extend the branching rule to cases involving additional locomotive types. We have conducted computational experiments using actual data from the Canadian National railway company. Simulated test-problems involving two or more locomotive types were solved over 1-, 2-, and 3-day rolling horizons. The cuts were successful in reducing the average integrality gap by 52% for the two-type case and by 34% when more than 25 types were used. Furthermore, the branch-first, cut-second approach was instrumental in improving the best known solution for an almost 2,000-leg weekly problem involving 26 locomotive types. It reduced the number of locomotives by 11, or 1.1%, at an equivalent savings of $3,000,000 per unit. Additional tests on different weekly data produced almost identical results.

The author shows that comparable performance can be obtained with a simpler alternative, a damped-trend version of exponential smoothing fitted to minimize the Mean-Absolute-Deviation (MAD) criterion. The results suggest that the performance of rule-based systems would be improved through this alternative and that time series forecasters should consider MAD fits in model development.

We posit that since institutions and labor networks vary by region, there regional variations in the localization of spillovers. We investigate the relationship between the mobility of major patent holders and the localization of technological knowledge through the analysis of patent citations of important semiconductor innovations. We find that knowledge localization is specific to only certain regions (particularly Silicon Valley) and that the degree of localization varies across regions. By analyzing data on the interfirm mobility of patent holders, we empirically show that the interfirm mobility of engineers influences the local transfer of knowledge. The flow of knowledge is embedded in regional labor networks.

It suggests that information embodied in process material can allow downstream tasks to uncover information about upstream tasks. It shows that downstream operators can use this information to negotiate interdependence problems with upstream operators. Data presented in this article begin to uncover when such information retrieval and exchange occurs, and how managers can encourage it. Finally, the article discusses implications for theories of operational design and governance.

J	Cachon, GP; Zipkin, PH				Cachon, GP; Zipkin, PH			Competitive and cooperative inventory policies in a two-stage supply chain	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain; game theory; multiechelon inventory; incentive contracts	LOW-DEMAND; MULTIECHELON; SYSTEMS	We investigate a two-stage serial supply chain with stationary stochastic demand and fixed transportation times. Inventory holding costs are charged at each stage, and each stage may incur a consumer backorder penalty cost, e.g. the upper stage (the supplier) may dislike backorders at the lower stage (the retailer). We consider two games. In both, the stages independently choose base stock policies to minimize their costs. The games differ in how the firms track their inventory levels (in one, the firms are committed to tracking echelon inventory; in the other they track local inventory). We compare the policies chosen under this competitive regime to those selected to minimize total supply chain costs, i.e., the optimal solution. We show that the games (nearly always) have a unique Nash equilibrium, and it differs from the optimal solution. Hence, competition reduces efficiency. Furthermore, the two games' equilibria are different, so the tracking method influences strategic behavior. We show that the system optimal solution can be achieved as a Nash equilibrium using simple linear transfer payments. The value of cooperation is context specific: In some settings competition increases total cost by only a fraction of a percent, whereas in other settings the cost increase is enormous. We also discuss Stackelberg equilibria.	Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA	Cachon, GP (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.

J	Van Mieghem, JA				Van Mieghem, JA			Coordinating investment, production, and subcontracting	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						coordination; production; subcontracting; outsourcing; supply contracts; supply chain; capacity; investment	INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; COMPETITION; OWNERSHIP	We value the option of subcontracting to improve financial performance and system coordination by analyzing a competitive stochastic investment game with recourse. The manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels. Then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties have the option to subcontract when deciding on their production and sales. We analyze and present outsourcing conditions for three contract types: (1) price-only contracts where an ex-ante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor; (2) incomplete contracts, where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer; and (3) state-dependent price-only and incomplete contracts for which we show an equivalence result. While subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system, only state-dependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions. The minimally sufficient price-only contract that coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number (6 in our model) of contingent scenarios. Our game-theoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier. We find that sometimes firms may be better off leaving some contract parameters unspecified ex-ante and agreeing to negotiate ex-post. Also, a price-focused strategy for managing subcontractors can backfire because a lower transfer price may decrease the manufacturer's profit.

J	Doyle, JR				Doyle, JR			Elicitation and context effects in judgments: Fixed sum versus fixed scale frames	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						numerical judgments; point allocation; direct rating; budget allocation; framing	DECISION QUALITY	Two apparently similar methods for making numerical judgments about a set of objects (point allocation and direct rating) have been shown to yield different profiles of values (here, numerical judgments) attached to Ranks. Direct rating typically leads to a nearly linear relationship of Value with Rank. When using point allocation, people tend to produce a half U-shape of Value with Rank, evidenced by a positive quadratic term in Rank, which is not present for direct rating. We argue that point allocation imposes a fixed-sum frame on the judgment task. Furthermore, certain problems, such as allocating a budget, are intrinsically framed as fixed-sum. These problems also lead to quadratic curvature of numerical judgment with Rank. We discuss the implications of these effects, both in formal and informal contexts.

We consider systems where some products are made-to-stock while another product line is made-to-order. We present a rich and effective class of strategies for which a variety of cost and performance measures can be evaluated and optimized efficiently by analytical methods. These include inventory level and waiting-time distributions, as well as average setup, holding, and backlogging costs. We also characterize how strategy choices are affected by the system parameters. The availability of efficient analytical evaluation and optimization methods permits us to address the impact of product line diversification or standardization on the performance of the manufacturing system, in particular the logistical implications of adding low-volume specialized models to a given make-to-stock product line.

J	Fisher, ML; Ittner, CD				Fisher, ML; Ittner, CD			The impact of product variety on automobile assembly operations: Empirical evidence and simulation analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product variety; assembly lines; auto industry	MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COST; LINES; WORK	This study examines the impact of product variety on automobile assembly plant performance using data from GM's Wilmington, Delaware plant, together with simulation analyses of a more general auto assembly line. We extend prior product variety studies by providing evidence on the magnitude of variety-related production losses, the mechanisms through which variety impacts performance, and the effects of option bundling and labor staffing policies on the costs of product variety. The empirical analyses indicate that greater day-to-day variability in option content (but not mean option content per car) has a significant adverse impact on total labor hours per car produced, overhead hours per car produced, assembly line downtime, minor repair and major rework, and inventory levels, but does not have a significant short-run impact on total direct labor hours. However, workstations with higher variability in option content have greater slack direct labor resources to buffer against process time variation, introducing an additional cost of product variety. The simulation results support these findings in that once each;workstation is optimally buffered against process time variation, product variety has an insignificant impact on direct assembly labor. The simulations also show that bundling options can reduce the amount of buffer capacity required, and that random variation is more pernicious to productivity than product variety, supporting the efforts of some auto makers to aggressively attack the causes of random variation.

J	Maxwell, K; Van Wassenhove, L; Dutta, S				Maxwell, K; Van Wassenhove, L; Dutta, S			Performance evaluation of general and company specific models in software development effort estimation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software productivity; software metrics; software project management; software development	COST-ESTIMATION MODELS; PRODUCTIVITY; VALIDATION	In this paper we present the results of our effort estimation analysis of a European Space Agency database consisting of 108 software development projects. We develop and evaluate simple empirical effort estimation models that include only those productivity factors found to be significant for these projects and determine if models based on a multicompany database can be successfully used to make effort estimations within a specific company. This was accomplished by developing company specific effort estimation models based on the significant productivity factors of a particular company and by comparing the results with those from general ESA models on a holdout sample of the company. To our knowledge, no other published research has yet developed and analysed software development effort estimation models in this way. Effort predictions made on a holdout sample of the individual company's projects using general models were less accurate than the company specific model. However, it is likely that in the absence of enough resources and data for a company to develop its own model, the application of general models may be more accurate than the use of guessing and intuition.

J	Zwick, R; Chen, XP				Zwick, R; Chen, XP			What price fairness? A bargaining study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						fairness; punishment; bargaining; fixed-costs	PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM; ULTIMATUM GAMES; GENDER DIFFERENCES; BEHAVIOR; STAKES; EQUITY; RECIPROCITY; PUNISHMENT; ANONYMITY; MARKET	Our study concerns bargaining behavior in situations where one party is in a stronger position than the other. We investigate both the tradeoff the favored party makes between pursuing his strategic advantage and giving weight to other players' concern for fairness, and the tradeoff the disadvantaged player makes between pursuing a fair outcome from a disadvantaged position and the cost of that pursuit, in particular, we hypothesize that the degree to which strategically strong players attempt to exploit their strategic advantage depends on their potential costs for doing so. Similarly, the degree to which weak players persist in seeking "fairness" is also a function of how much it (potentially) costs them to do so. Students negotiated in pairs over the division of $HK50 using a finite horizon, fixed-cost (per rejection) alternating offer rule. Each pair consisted of a high-cost and a low-cost bargainer. In accordance with the hypothesis, the willingness of the high-cost bargainers to demand fairness and to persist in their demands was a function of how much it cost them to do so, and the degree to which the low-cost bargainers attempted to exploit their strategic advantage depended on their own cost of rejection. We conclude that "fairness" has a price such that the higher its price, the lower the "demand" for it. This suggests that demands for fairness are subject to cost-benefit evaluation, are in this sense deliberate, and are well thought out.

J	Boyer, KK				Boyer, KK			Evolutionary patterns of flexible automation and performance: A longitudinal study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						advanced manufacturing technology; technology management; operations strategy; longitudinal research; empirical research	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; BUSINESS STRATEGY; FLEXIBILITY; SYSTEMS	This study presents a longitudinal analysis of patterns of investment in advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT) and financial performance. Investments in AMT from 112 manufacturing plants in the metal-working industries are examined. Data were collected via a mail survey administered to 202 plants in 1994, and readministered to 112 of the same plants in 1996. This study seeks to fill a void in the area of technology management, which is comprised primarily of cross-sectional studies that do not address the dynamic nature of investments in technology. Four major conclusions are drawn from the data. First, several individual technologies have higher investments in 1996 than in 1994. In particular, electronic mail has the largest increase in investment, a finding that suggests that manufacturing firms are finding ways to take advantage of the exploding potential of electronic communication. Our second conclusion is that plants invest in technology in an incremental fashion over time rather than using an all-or-nothing approach. Plants with low investments follow one of three technology strategies as their investments in AMTs evolve: (1) continued low investment, (2) investment primarily in design-based technologies, or (3) equalized investment in design, manufacturing, and administrative AMTs. Third, analysis of the degree of manufacturing involvement in developing business strategy indicates that plants that have a more proactive role for manufacturing invest greater resources in AMTs. Finally, while AMT investment was not positively associated with performance in a cross-sectional analysis, longitudinal analysis of data collected two years later does reveal a relationship. In short, the analysis supports the proposition that there is a lag between initial investment and resulting performance improvements.

J	Cachon, GP				Cachon, GP			Managing supply chain demand variability with scheduled ordering policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; multi-echelon inventory; bullwhip effect	MULTIECHELON INVENTORY MODEL; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; ALLOCATION; INFORMATION; INTERVALS	This paper studies supply chain demand variability in a model with one supplier and N retailers that face stochastic demand. Retailers implement scheduled ordering policies: Orders occur at fixed intervals and are equal to some multiple of a fixed batch size. A method is presented that exactly evaluates costs. Previous research demonstrates that the supplier's demand variance declines as the retailers' order intervals are balanced, i.e., the same number of retailers order each period. This research shows that the supplier's demand variance will (generally) decline as the retailers' order interval is lengthened or as their batch size is increased. Lower supplier demand variance can certainly lead to lower inventory at the supplier. This paper finds that reducing supplier demand variance with scheduled ordering policies can also lower total supply chain costs.

The network has an infinite number of small users and is managed by a system manager (SM) whose objective is to maximize the net value of the system as a whole. The objective of this paper is to study pricing mechanisms that induce the optimal arrival rates when the SM has no full knowledge of the demand in advance. We investigate the system behavior under three alternative dynamic pricing rules and users' expectations models, and characterize the equilibrium and its stability conditions.

J	Whitt, W				Whitt, W			Predicting queueing delays	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						service systems; telephone call centers; predicting delays; communicating anticipated delays; predicting response times	SERVICE	This paper investigates the possibility of predicting each customer's waiting time in queue before starting service in a multiserver service system with the first-come first-served service discipline, such as a telephone call center. A predicted waiting-time distribution or an appropriate summary statistic such as the mean or the 90th percentile may be communicated to the customer upon arrival and possibly thereafter in order to improve customer satisfaction. The predicted waiting-time distribution may also be used by the service provider to better manage the service system, e.g., to help decide when to add additional service agents. The possibility of making reliable predictions is enhanced by exploiting information about system state, including the number of customers in the system ahead of the current customer. Additional information beyond the number of customers in the system may be obtained by classifying customers and the service agents to which they are assigned. For nonexponential service times, the elapsed service times of customers in service can often be used to advantage to compute conditional-remaining-service-time distributions. Approximations are proposed to convert the distributions of remaining service times into the distribution of the desired customer waiting time. The analysis reveals the advantage from exploiting additional information.

We consider the problem of apportioning item production to distinct manufacturing lines with different costs and capabilities (production rates). The objective is to minimize the long-run average production, setup, inventory, and shortage penalty costs (due to lost sales). Restricting attention to rotation schedules, we develop a concave minimization model of the problem, generate heuristic solutions and a lower bound on the cost of any feasible solution. Computational experiments indicate that our heuristic solution is within a few percent of the lower bound. We also investigate sensitivity of costs to model parameters,and illustrate how our model may be used to determine target values for equipment utilization.

Strategy scholars suggest the nature of the markets, competition, and decisions made by the management team affect a new venture's survival chances. The findings demonstrate that VCs' assessment policies are predominantly consistent with those proposed by strategy scholars-providing insight into why VCs consider certain criteria in their assessment of new venture survival as well as why some criteria are more important in their assessment than others. Through this increased understanding of venture capitalists' decision making, entrepreneurs seeking capital may be better able to address their requests for funding to those criteria venture capitalists find most critical to the survival of a new venture. venture capitalists may use these findings to better understand their own decision making process, which, in turn, provides the opportunity to increase evaluation efficiency.

J	Lee, H; Whang, SJ				Lee, H; Whang, SJ			Decentralized multi-echelon supply chains: Incentives and information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; incentive alignment; decentralized control; multi-echelon inventory systems; information management	QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; MODEL; POLICIES; VENDOR; AGENCY	Consider a supply chain in which a product must pass through multiple sites located in series before it is finally delivered to outside customers. Incentive problems may arise in this system when decisions are delegated to corresponding site managers, each maximizing his/her own performance metric. From the overall system's point of view, the decentralized supply chain may not be as efficient as the centralized one. In practice, alternative performance mechanisms are often used to align the incentives of the different managers in a supply chain. This paper discusses the cost conservation incentive compatibility, and informational decentralizability properties of these mechanisms. Ln particular, for a special type of supply chain, we show that a performance measurement scheme involving transfer pricing, consignment, shortage reimbursement, and an additional backlog penalty at the last downstream site satisfies all these properties.

J	Ulrich, KT; Ellison, DJ				Ulrich, KT; Ellison, DJ			Holistic customer requirements and the design-select decision	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; product development; customer requirements; make-buy decision	VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; LESSONS	When confronted with the task of developing a new product, a firm chooses either to design new components, unique to the product application, or to select components from those offered in the catalogs of suppliers or from those already in use in its other products. We call this the design-select decision. The benefits of selecting an existing component include minimizing investment, exploiting economies of scale, and preserving organizational focus. On the other hand, designing product-specific components allows a firm to (a) maximize product performance with respect to holistic customer requirements-those requirements that arise in a complex way from most of the components of a product; (b) minimize the size and mass of a product; and (c) minimize the true variable costs of production. When these benefits exceed those from selecting existing components, firms will tend to design product-specific components. Our approach is to develop this theory by linking concepts from marketing, technological innovation, and engineering design. This theory yields four testable hypotheses.

J	Jehiel, P				Jehiel, P			Information aggregation and communication in organizations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information; communication; organization	FIRM; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Operating units must communicate their private information regarding decisions to be taken in organizations. This paper characterizes the optimal communication structures assuming that (i) a decision maker is fired whenever he makes a decision that proves wrong ex post relative to the status quo; and ii) direct communication in a group of k units may result in the loss of messages with a probability that solely depends on the group size. Several levels of partitioning with direct communication taking place in each group are required. It is shown that there exists a group size that allows communication technology to be exploited optimally: The optimal communication structure is such that it is essentially composed of groups of this size only at every level of partitioning.

J	Bollen, NPB				Bollen, NPB			Real options and product life cycles	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						real option; product life cycle; contingent claim	INVESTMENT; FLEXIBILITY; VALUATION	In this paper, I develop an option valuation framework that explicitly incorporates a product life cycle. I then use the framework to value the real option to change a project's capacity. Standard techniques for valuing real options typically ignore product life cycle models and specify instead a constant expected growth rate for demand or price. I show that this specification can lead to significant error in the valuation of capacity options. In particular, the standard technique tends to undervalue the option to contract capacity and overvalue the option to expand capacity. This result has important implications for capital investment decisions, especially in high-technology industries that feature regular introductions of newly improved products.

J	Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA				Cachon, GP; Lariviere, MA			Capacity allocation using past sales: When to turn-and-earn	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity allocation; bullwhip effect; supply chain management; game theory		Consider a supplier selling to multiple retailers. Demand varies across periods, but the supplier's capacity and wholesale price are fixed. If demand is high, the retailers' needs exceed capacity, and the supplier must implement an allocation mechanism to dole out production. We examine how the choice of mechanism impacts retailer actions and supply chain performance. In particular,we analyze turn-and-earn allocation, a method commonly used in the automobile industry. This scheme bases current allocations on past sales and thus enables retailers to influence-their future allocations; they compete for scarce capacity even if they do not compete for customers. We show that turn-and-earn induces the retailers to increase their sales when demand is low and the supplier's capacity is otherwise underutilized. Supplier profits thus increase. The impact on the supply chain depends on how restrictive capacity is. With mildly tight capacity, the retailers' higher sales rate does not significantly lower their profits but does reduce the cost of idle capacity. Supply chain performance improves; With extremely tight capacity, the retailers' intense competition dissipates more profits than the supplier gains, and supply chain performance suffers. Consequently, turn-and-earn does not generally coordinate the system. It is best characterized asa means for the supplier to increase her profits at the expense of the retailers and potentially even the supply chain. Furthermore, these results hold even if the retailers can hold inventory in anticipation of scarce capacity.

J	Ichniowski, C; Shaw, K				Ichniowski, C; Shaw, K			The effects of human resource management systems on economic performance: An international comparison of US and Japanese plants	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						human resource management; productivity; Japan	UNITED-STATES; ORGANIZATION; WORK	This study uses personally collected data from 41 steel production lines to assess the effects of Japanese and U.S. human resource management (HRM)) practices on worker productivity. The Japanese production Lines employ a common system of HRM practices including: problem-solving teams, extensive orientation, training throughout employees' careers,extensive information sharing, rotation across jobs, employment security, and profit sharing. A majority of U.S. plants now have one or two features of this system of HRM practices, but only a minority have a comprehensive system of innovative work practices that parallels the full system of practices found among the Japanese manufacturers. We find that the Japanese lines are significantly more productive than the U.S. lines. However, U.S. manufacturers that have adopted a full system of innovative HRM practices patterned after the Japanese system achieve levels of productivity and quality equal to the performance of the Japanese manufacturers. This study's evidence helps reconcile conflicting views about the effectiveness of adopting Japanese-style worker involvement schemes in the United States. United States manufacturers that have adopted a definition of employee participation that extends only to problem-solving teams or information sharing do not see large improvements in productivity. However, U.S. manufacturers that adopt a broader definition of participation that mimics the full Japanese HRM system see substantial performance gains.

J	Campbell, GM				Campbell, GM			Cross-utilization of workers whose capabilities differ	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						manpower scheduling; service operations management; mathematical programming	PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS; TOUR SCHEDULING PROBLEM	This paper develops a model for allocating cross-trained workers at the beginning of a shift multidepartment service environment. It assumes departments are trying to maximize objective functions that are concave with respect to the number of workers assigned. Worker capabilities are described by parameters that range from zero to one, with fractional values representing workers who are less than fully qualified. The nonlinear programming model presented is a variant of the generalized assignment: problem. The model is used in a series of experiments to investigate the value of cross-utilization as a function of factors such as demand variability and levels of cross-training. Results show that the benefits of cross-utilization can be substantial, and in many cases a small degree of cross-training can capture most of the benefits. Beyond a certain amount additional cross-training adds little additional value, and the preferred amount depends heavily on the level of demand variability.

Typical for these hybrid systems is, that both the output of the manufacturing process and the output of the remanufacturing process can be used to fulfill customer demands. Here, we consider a relatively simple hybrid system, related to a single component durable product. For this system, we present a methodology to analyse a PUSH control strategy tin which all returned products are remanufactured as early as possible) and a PULL control strategy tin which all returned products are remanufactured as late as is convenient). The main contributions of this paper are (i) to compare traditional systems without remanufacturing to PUSH and to PULL controlled systems with remanufacturing, and (ii) to derive managerial insights into the inventory related effects of remanufacturing.

J	Alrefaei, MH; Andradottir, S				Alrefaei, MH; Andradottir, S			A simulated annealing algorithm with constant temperature for discrete stochastic optimization	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						global optimization; discrete parameters; simulated annealing; simulation optimization	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; NOISY	We present a modification of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems. Like the original simulated annealing algorithm, our method has the hill climbing feature, so it can find global optimal solutions to discrete stochastic optimization problems with many local solutions. However, our method differs from the original simulated annealing algorithm in that it uses a constant (rather than decreasing) temperature. We consider two approaches for estimating the optimal solution. The first approach uses the number of visits the algorithm makes to the different: states (divided by a normalizer) to estimate the optimal solution. The second approach uses the state that has the best average estimated objective function value as estimate of the optimal solution. We show that both variants of our method are guaranteed to converge almost surely to the set of global optimal solutions, and discuss how our work applies in the discrete deterministic optimization setting. We also show how both variants can be applied for solving discrete optimization problems when the objective function values are estimated using either transient or steady-state simulation. Finally, we include some encouraging numerical results documenting the behavior of the two variants of our algorithm when applied for solving two versions of a particular discrete stochastic optimization problem, and compare their performance with that of other variants of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems.

However, research on the applicability of the concept in different technological environments remains scarce. So far, very few industry-specific studies have statistically confirmed an accelerating effect of overlap. In the present article we statistically measure the effectiveness of overlapping development activities in reducing project completion time. Building on analytical research in operations management, we argue that this effectiveness differs with the organization's capability to resolve uncertainty early in the process. Projects benefit more from overlap if they are able to resolve uncertainty early. This contingency view to overlapping development activities is tested based on data from 140 completed development projects across several global electronics industries.

J	Lieberman, MB; Demeester, L				Lieberman, MB; Demeester, L			Inventory reduction and productivity growth: Linkages in the Japanese automotive industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; productivity; just-in-time manufacturing; auto industry; Japan; empirical study		The Literature on JIT production suggests a causal Link between work-in-process inventory and manufacturing productivity. Such a connection has been described in numerous case studies but never tested statistically. This paper uses historical data for 52 Japanese automotive companies to evaluate the inventory-productivity relationship. We find that firms increased their productivity rank during periods of substantial inventory reduction. More detailed tests suggest that inventory reductions stimulated gains in productivity On average, each 10% reduction in inventory led to about a 1% gain in labor productivity, with a lag of about one year. Such effects were more immediate for Toyota affiliates, but undetectable for close suppliers of Nissan. These findings imply that inventory reduction served as an important driver of process improvement for many Japanese automotive companies, although some firms emphasized other methods.

J	Chintagunta, PK				Chintagunta, PK			Variety seeking, purchase timing, and the "lightning bolt" brand choice model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						brand choice dynamics; hazard models; perceptual maps	PANEL-DATA; HETEROGENEITY	The "Lightning Bolt" (LB) model provides a comprehensive framework for accommodating the effects of habit persistence, unobserved heterogeneity, and state dependence on household brand choice behavior. This paper presents a discrete, dynamic brand-choice model that belongs to the LB class of models. We propose a method for incorporating the effects of variety seeking into the LB model formulation. The proposed formulation explicitly links brand choice and purchase timing behavior via the effect of state dependence. This state-dependence based linkage between brand choice and purchase timing comes about due to the attribute satiation notion associated with household variety seeking behavior. Empirical implementation of the model specification requires recognizing that interpurchase times, like brand choices, also depend upon marketing variables and household characteristics. A hazard model is specified to capture this relationship. Empirical results are presented using household-level data for two different products. Our results reveal the following. (1) State dependence effects decline over time. Hence, households' brand switching and repeat purchase probabilities vary over time, independent of any variation in marketing mix activities. (2) Accounting for the effects of marketing variables on interpurchase times may be important when empirically estimating the preposed model. While the nature of substantive implications is largely unchanged, the magnitudes of the different effects are nevertheless affected. (3) We find evidence for purchase reinforcement land its effects declining over time), but no evidence for attribute satiation based variety seeking behavior.

In this paper, we formulate a game-theoretic model of firm interaction to analyze the dynamic price and advertising competition among firms in a given product market. Firm (or brand) level demand functions account for the contemporaneous and carry-over effects of these marketing activities, and also allow for the effects of competitor actions. Firms take into consideration the actions of their rivals, as well as their own demand and cost functions (both production and advertising) when determining the profit-maximizing price and advertising levels. Our formulation enables us to quantify not only the direction and magnitude of competitive reactions, but also to identify the underlying form of market conduct that generates the particular pattern of interaction. We specify and estimate a fully structural econometric model for three firms constituting a distinct sub-market within a personal-care product category. We estimate the demand and competitive interaction parameters, as well as the production and advertising cost functions for each firm. We then derive implications for competitive interactions and market structure. Interestingly, we find that while firms seem to compete on advertising, they price cooperatively, thereby enhancing their price-cost margins.

One of the classes of our risk measures presumes that there is no risk when there is no uncertainty involved, and the other allows different degenerate lotteries to be evaluated with different values of "risk." The former has more prescriptive appeal in risky decision making, but the latter may have more descriptive power for subjective risk judgments. Our risk measures can also take into account the asymmetric effects of losses and gains on perceived risk based on an appropriate choice of the standard measure of risk. The perceived risk models we propose unify a large body of empirical evidence regarding risk judgments, and provide sufficient flexibility to better capture people's perceptions of risk than previously developed risk models, in particular, our risk measures provide clear ways to accommodate financial measures of risk and psychological measures of risk, and they can be incorporated into preference models in an appealing form based on mean-risk tradeoffs.

To make this potential a reality, businesses must focus on the values of their customers. We interviewed over one-hundred individuals about all the pros and cons of using Internet commerce that they experienced or envisioned. The results were organized into twenty-five categories of objectives that were influenced by Internet purchases. These categories were separated into means objectives and fundamental objectives used to describe the bottom line consequences of concern to customers. These results are applicable to designing an Internet commerce system for a business, creating and redesigning products, and increasing value to customers. The set of fundamental objectives also provides the foundation for developing a quantitative model of customer values.

We introduce so-called partially renewable resources by assuming for each resource a capacity on subsets of periods. The concept of partially renewable resources is a fundamental tool in order to make, e.g., timetabling and shift scheduling aspects, amenable to project scheduling. In addition, partially renewable resources serve to model complicated labor regulations. Furthermore, they cover traditional renewable and nonrenewable resource constraints as special cases. We consider makespan minimization as objective. For the exact solution of the problem we employ a basic enumeration scheme. Ln order to speed up convergence, we formulate bounds which take into account future resource consumption of partially renewable resources. Moreover, we generalize the serial scheduling scheme in order to get fast approximation methods. A rigorous assessment of the procedures is provided by solving ProGen instances generated under a full factorial test design. Besides the well-known problem parameters we employ additionally three parameters which control the generation of partially renewable resources.

J	Das, TK; Gosavi, A; Mahadevan, S; Marchalleck, N				Das, TK; Gosavi, A; Mahadevan, S; Marchalleck, N			Solving semi-Markov decision problems using average reward reinforcement learning	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						semi-Markov decision processes (SMDP); reinforcement learning; average reward; preventive maintenance		A large class of problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty, of which the underlying probability structure is a Markov process, can be modeled as stochastic dynamic programs (referred to, in general, as Markov decision problems or MDPs). However, the computational complexity of the classical MDP algorithms, such as value iteration and policy iteration, is prohibitive and can grow intractably with the size of the problem and its related data. Furthermore, these techniques require for each action the one step transition probability and reward matrices, and obtaining these is often unrealistic for large and complex systems. Recently, there has been much interest in a simulation-based stochastic approximation framework called reinforcement learning (RL), for computing near optimal policies for MDPs. RL has been successfully applied to very large problems, such as elevator scheduling, and dynamic channel allocation of cellular telephone systems. In this paper, we extend RL to a more general class of decision tasks that are referred to as semi-Markov decision problems (SMDPs). In particular, we focus on SMDPs under the average-reward criterion. We present a new model-free RL algorithm called SMART (Semi-Markov Average Reward Technique). We present a detailed study of this algorithm on a combinatorially large problem of determining the optimal preventive maintenance schedule of a production inventory system. Numerical results from both the theoretical model and the RL algorithm are presented and compared.

J	Ruben, RA; Jacobs, FR				Ruben, RA; Jacobs, FR			Batch construction heuristics and storage assignment strategies for walk/ride and pick systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						operations management; warehouse management; order batching; storage assignment strategies	AUTOMATIC WAREHOUSING SYSTEMS; RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS; ORDER; MODELS; ALGORITHMS; OPERATION; POLICIES; DESIGN; LAYOUT	The retrieval of items from storage is a chore faced by virtually every business concern. Walk/ride and pick systems are a popular method for performing this chore in many applications. When retrieval requests consist of multiple items, order pickers must travel to numerous storage locations to complete each order. When these requests are made in sufficient volume, a method of order retrieval known as batch picking is often used. Batch picking is a popular approach in the mail-order industry and is employed in industrial settings such as tool cribs and in warehouses, which service assembly line operations. Batch construction heuristics are developed and tested under three strategies for assigning storage space to individual items that have been suggested in the literature. Our results are derived from the simulation of a single hypothetical warehouse model. Specifically, we employ a model that is square in travel distance and assume the walk and pick method of order retrieval with sequential one-way travel. Sensitivity analysis is performed on workforce level and batch size. Our results indicate that the methods used for constructing batches of orders and for assigning storage space to individual items can significantly impact order retrieval efforts in warehouses of this type.

J	Cooper, WW; Park, KS; Yu, G				Cooper, WW; Park, KS; Yu, G			IDEA and AR-IDEA: Models for dealing with imprecise data in DEA	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DEA efficiency; imprecise data; assurance regions	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; ORDINAL RELATIONS; FACTOR WEIGHTS; EFFICIENCY; MULTIPLIERS; CRITERIA	Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric approach to evaluating the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) that use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. An assumption underlying DEA is that all the data assume the form of specific numerical values. In some applications, however, the data may be imprecise. For instance, some of the data may be known only within specified bounds, while other data may be known only in terms of ordinal relations. DEA with imprecise data or, more compactly, the Imprecise Data Envelopment Analysis (IDEA) method developed in this paper permits mixtures of imprecisely- and exactly-known data, which the IDEA models transform into ordinary linear programming forms. This is carried even further in the present paper to comprehend the now extensively employed Assurance Region (AR) concepts in which bounds are placed on the variables rather than the data. We refer to this approach as AR-IDEA, because it replaces conditions on the variables with transformations of the data and thus also aligns the developments we describe in this paper with what are known as cone-ratio envelopments in DEA. As a result, one unified approach, referred to as the AR-IDEA model, is achieved which includes not only imprecise data capabilities but also assurance region and cone-ratio envelopment concepts.

Our technique allows us to identify potential output gains (or equivalently potential cost savings) from reform. We can also identify which personnel groups are likely to gain and lose under this reform. When we apply our model to a sample of Texas school districts, we find evidence that the educational establishment has substantial economic rents to protect from school reform, and that the primary beneficiaries of reform are likely to be affluent school districts with few minority students. The technique, which relies on the relationship between the direct and indirect distance functions, can be easily generalized to measure the potential gains from removing other input restrictions such as union work rules, environmental regulations, or deed restrictions.
