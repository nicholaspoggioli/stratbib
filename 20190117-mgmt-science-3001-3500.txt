J	Fisher, M; Ramdas, K; Ulrich, K				Fisher, M; Ramdas, K; Ulrich, K			Component sharing in the management of product variety: A study of automotive braking systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						component sharing; product variety; commonality; product platform; product design	DESIGN	Product variety in many industries has increased steadily throughout this century. Component sharing-using the same version of a component across multiple products-is increasingly viewed by companies as a way to offer high variety in the marketplace while retaining low variety in their operations. Yet, despite the popularity of component sharing in industry, little is known about how to design an effective component-sharing strategy or about the factors that influence the success of such a strategy. In this paper we critically examine component sharing using automotive front brakes as an example. We consider three basic questions: (1) What are the key drivers and trade-offs of component-sharing decisions? (2) How much variation exists in actual component-sharing practice? and (3) How can this variation be explained? To answer these questions, we develop an analytic model of component sharing and show through empirical testing that this model explains much of the variation in sharing practice for automotive braking systems. We find that the optimal number of brake rotors is a function of the range of vehicle weights, sales volume, fixed component design and tooling costs, variable costs, and the variation in production volume across the models of the product line. We conclude with a discussion of the general managerial implications of our findings.

In addition, risk is also mitigated through reinsurance provisions. Although a provider may not want this reinsurance, participation is mandatory. We develop a framework for evaluating financial risk under the PPS. We use this framework to examine optional reinsurance as an alternative risk mitigation mechanism. We illustrate an application of optional reinsurance using data for Medicare psychiatric inpatient services. Our analysis indicates that viable schemes exist for implementing optional reinsurance as a prospective payment option.

We develop a Tabu Search method for the problem that incorporates long term memory, probabilistic move selections, hierarchical move evaluation, candidate list strategies and an elite solution recovery strategy. Computational results for test data show that the Tabu Search heuristic finds optimal solutions for all test problems that can be solved exactly by a branch-and-cut algorithm, while running about three orders of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm. In addition, for larger size problems that cannot be solved exactly, the tabu search algorithm outperforms the best local search heuristic currently available. The performance gap favoring Tabu Search increases significantly for more difficult problem instances.

J	Lariviere, MA; Porteus, EL				Lariviere, MA; Porteus, EL			Stalking information: Bayesian inventory management with unobserved lost sales	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian inventory management; unobserved lost sales; information acquisition; dropping products; Bayesian dynamic programming; newsvendor distributions; dimensionality reduction; product profitability; multiple markets; favoring small markets		Retailers are frequently uncertain about the underlying demand distribution of a new product. When taking the empirical Bayesian approach of Scarf (1959), they simultaneously stock the product over time and learn about the distribution. Assuming that unmet demand is lost and unobserved, this learning must be based on observing sales rather than demand, which differs from sales in the event of a stockout. Using the framework and results of Braden and Freimer (1991), the cumulative learning about the underlying demand distribution is captured by two parameters, a scale parameter that reflects the predicted size of the underlying market, and a shape parameter that indicates both the size of the market and the precision with which the underlying distribution is known. An important simplification result of Scarf (1960) and Azoury (1985), which allows the scale parameter to be removed from the optimization, is shown to extend to this setting. We present examples that reveal two interesting phenomena: (1) A retailer may hope that, compared to stocking out, realized demand will be strictly less than the stock level, even though stocking out would signal a stochastically larger demand distribution, and (2) it can be optimal to drop a product after a period of successful sales. We also present specific conditions under which the following results hold: (1) Investment in excess stocks to enhance learning will occur in every dynamic problem, and (2) a product is never dropped after a period of poor sales. The model is extended to multiple independent markets whose distributions depend proportionately on a single unknown parameter. We argue that smaller markets should be given better service as an effective means of acquiring information.

Choices in repeated gambles and retirement investments	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						myopic loss aversion; retirement planning; asset allocation; risk aversion	EQUITY PREMIUM; INFORMATION; PUZZLE	We study how decision makers choose when faced with multiple plays of a gamble or investment. When evaluating multiple plays of a simple mixed gamble, a chance to win x or lose y, subjects show a sensitivity to the amount to lose on a single trial, holding the distribution of returns for the portfolio constant; that is, they display "myopic loss aversion." Many subjects who decline multiple plays of such a gamble will accept it when shown the resulting distribution. This analysis is applied to the problem of retirement investing. We show that workers invest more of their retirement savings in stocks if they are shown long-term (rather than one-year) rates of return.

A key question about such operations is whether the collision risk they entail is acceptably low. Pursuing that issue, we explore a method for estimating the chance that a plane on final approach during instrument flight conditions will "blunder" in a way that could imperil nearby aircraft. We argue that the method could yield an attractive combination of high estimation accuracy and relatively low cost.

The advent of more complicated control chart schemes has necessitated the use of Monte Carlo simulation in the design process, especially in the evaluation of performance measures such as average run length. in this paper, we apply two gradient estimation procedures-perturbation analysis and the Likelihood ratio/score function method-to derive estimators that can be used in gradient-based optimization algorithms and in sensitivity analysis when Monte Carlo simulation is employed. We illustrate the techniques on a general control chart that includes the Shewhart chart and the exponentially-weighted moving average chart as special cases.

The project involves collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes, and organizing these examples in an on-line "process handbook." The handbook is intended to help people: (1) redesign existing organizational processes, (2) invent new organizational processes (especially ones that take advantage of information technology), and (3) share ideas about organizational practices. A key element of the work is an approach to analyzing processes at various levels of abstraction, thus capturing both the details of specific processes as well as the "deep structure" of their similarities. This approach uses ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about managing dependencies. A primary advantage of the approach is that it allows people to explicitly represent the similarities land differences) among related processes and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process could be performed. In addition to describing this new approach, the work reported here demonstrates the basic technical feasibility of these ideas and gives one example of their use in a field study.

This paper considers a multiserver queueing system with impatient customers, where the customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service requirements have a general distribution. A simple and insightful solution is presented for the loss probability. The solution is exact for exponential services and is an excellent heuristic for general service times.

J	Kim, H; Park, S				Kim, H; Park, S			Optimality of the symmetric workload allocation in a single-server flow line system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						flow line system; symmetric workload allocation; tandem queues	REVERSIBILITY	This paper provides a proof of the symmetrical allocation property (SAP), conjectured in an earlier work on the workload allocation problem for a manufacturing: flow line system. The system consists of N single-Erlang servers in series having a common interstation buffer capacity. SAP says a symmetric workload allocation exists among the optimal solutions. We first show the reciprocal of the throughput is increasing and jointly convex, not component-wisely, in workloads. Then we apply the line reversibility property to obtain an alternative optimal allocation symmetric for any optimal workload allocation that is asymmetric. A sufficient condition for SAP to hold is also given, which relaxes the hypothesizing assumptions on the service-time distribution and interstation buffer capacities.

J	Jain, DC; Muller, E; Vilcassim, NJ				Jain, DC; Muller, E; Vilcassim, NJ			Pricing patterns of cellular phones and phonecalls: A segment-level analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						cellular communications; dynamic pricing; customer segmentation; repeated games	EQUILIBRIA	One expectation of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the early stages of the cellular communications industry was that the presence of two licensees in each market would ensure competition, and thereby result in declining prices over time for both cellular phones (handsets) and phonecalls. However, industry observers have noted recently that although the price of handsets has declined over time, the price of the phonecalls has not. We investigate this interesting pricing issue by modeling the market interaction between the providers of cellular services and also their interaction with customers using a game theoretic framework. A critical assumption in the development of our model is that there exist segments of customers with different valuations, usage levels, and price sensitivities for cellular service. Empirically, we provide support for the existence of two customer segments (viz., Business/Professional and Personal) from both secondary data on industry usage and revenue, and primary data collected from a conjoint analysis study of cellular service customers. From the latter source, we also establish that the Business/Professional customers are more sensitive to prices of phonecalls than the Personal segment. From our analytical model, we characterize the conditions under which penetration and skimming pricing strategies for the handsets are profit-maximizing from the sellers' standpoint, and derive the corresponding price of phonecalls. One of our main analytical results is that a competitive structure can result in lower prices over time for the handset, but higher prices for the phonecalls, depending on production costs of the handset. We are thus able to provide a theoretical explanation for the observed price patterns for the handset and phonecalls.

Economists argue that the new firms fail because entrepreneurs inefficiently manage production and organizational design (Williamson 1985). Sociologists (e.g., Granovetter 1985) have typically viewed this explanation as undersocialized, and argue that institutional legitimacy must also be considered to explain the survival of new firms. This paper examines the survival of 1292 new franchisors established in the United States from 1979-1996. The results show that institutional legitimacy adds to economic explanations for the survival of new franchisors and suggests the importance of a properly socialized explanation.

J	Loch, CH; Huberman, BA				Loch, CH; Huberman, BA			A punctuated-equilibrium model of technology diffusion	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						technology diffusion; punctuated equilibria; network externalities; path dependence; dynamic systems; evolutionary models; simulation	INNOVATION DIFFUSION; DISCONTINUITIES; DYNAMICS	We present an evolutionary model of technology diffusion in which an old and a new technology are available, both of which improve their performance incrementally over time. Technology adopters make repeated choices between the established and the new technology based on their perceived performance, which is subject to uncertainty. Both technologies exhibit positive externalities, or performance benefits from others using the same technology. We find that the superior technology will not necessarily be broadly adopted by the population. Externalities cause two stable usage equilibria to exist, one with the old technology being the standard and the other with the new technology the standard. Punctuations, or sudden shifts, in these equilibria determine the patterns of technology diffusion. The time for an equilibrium punctuation depends on the rate of incremental improvement of both technologies, and on the system's resistance to switching between equilibria. If the new technology has a higher rate of incremental improvement, it is adopted faster, and adoption may precede performance parity if the system's resistance to switching is low. Adoption of the new technology may trail performance parity if the system's resistance to switching is high.

J	Anupindi, R; Bassok, Y				Anupindi, R; Bassok, Y			Centralization of stocks: Retailers vs. manufacturer	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; pooling; manufacturer; retailers; competition; cooperation; market search; information system		A well-known result in inventory theory is that physical centralization of stocks in a system with multiple retailers decreases total costs and increases total profits for the retailers. However, does this centralization also benefit the manufacturer, whose goods the retailers stock, when customers unsatisfied at retailers due to stock-outs are considered lost sales? In this paper we consider a model with two retailers and one manufacturer We then compare two systems: one in which the retailers hold stocks separately and the other in which they cooperate to centralize stocks at a single location. We show that whether or not centralization of stocks by retailers increases profits for the manufacturer depends on the level of "market search" in the supply chain. Market search is measured as the fraction of customers who, unsatisfied at their "local" retailer due to a stock-out, search for the good at, the other retailer before leaving the system. Specifically, we show that there exists a threshold level for market search above which the manufacturer loses. Furthermore, for "very high" search levels, even the system profit (sum of manufacturer and retailer profits) may decrease upon centralization. We then compare the performance of the two systems under optimal pricing/subsidy mechanisms and show that often a manufacturer is better off in a decentralized system with high market search. We conclude with a discussion of the role of information systems in the decentralized systems.

J	Whitt, W				Whitt, W			Improving service by informing customers about anticipated delays	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						service systems; telephone call centers; balking; reneging; abandonments; retrials; birth-and-death processes; communicating anticipated delays	POINTWISE STATIONARY APPROXIMATION; ERLANG LOSS MODEL; QUEUES; BLOCKING; RATES	This paper investigates the effect upon performance in a service system, such as a telephone call center, of giving waiting customers state information. Ln particular, the paper studies two M/M/s/r queueing models with balking and reneging. For simplicity, it is assumed that each customer is willing to wait a fixed time before beginning service. However, customers differ, so the delay tolerances for successive customers are random. In particular, it is assumed that the delay tolerance of each customer is zero with probability beta, and is exponentially distributed with mean alpha(-1) conditional on the delay tolerance being positive. Let N be the number of customers found by an arrival. In Model 1, no state information is provided, so that if N greater than or equal to s, the customer balks with probability beta; if the customer enters the system, he reneges after an exponentially distributed time with mean alpha(-1) if he has not begun service by that time. In Model 2, if N = s + k greater than or equal to s, then the customer is told the system state k and the remaining service times of all customers in the system, so that he balks with probability beta + (1 + beta)(1 - q(k)), where q(k) = P(T > S-k), T is exponentially distributed with mean (alpha(-1), S-k is the sum of k + 1 independent exponential random variables each with mean (S mu)(-1), and mu(-l) is the mean service time. In Model 2, all reneging is replaced by balking. The number of customers in the system for Model 1 is shown to be larger than that for Model 2 in the likelihood-ratio stochastic ordering. Thus, customers are more Likely to be blocked in Model 1 and are more Likely to be served without waiting in Model 2. Algorithms are also developed for computing important performance measures in these, and more general, birth-and-death models.

J	Clemen, RT; Reilly, T				Clemen, RT; Reilly, T			Correlations and copulas for decision and risk analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						measures of dependence; Kendall's tau; Spearman's rho; copulas; multivariate normal copula; decision analysis process	BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS; RANDOM-VARIABLES; APPROXIMATIONS; MARGINALS; MODELS	The construction of a probabilistic model is a key step in most decision and risk analyses. Typically this is done by defining a joint distribution in terms of marginal and conditional distributions for the model's random variables. We describe an alternative approach that uses a copula to construct joint distributions and pairwise correlations to incorporate dependence among the variables. The approach is designed specifically to permit the use of an expert's subjective judgments of marginal distributions and correlations. The copula that underlies the multivariate normal distribution provides the basis for modeling dependence, but arbitrary marginals are allowed. We discuss how correlations can be assessed using techniques that are familiar to decision analysts, and we report the results of an empirical study of the accuracy of the assessment methods. The approach is demonstrated in the context of a simple example, including a study of the sensitivity of the results to the assessed correlations.

J	Taylor, JW; Bunn, DW				Taylor, JW; Bunn, DW			A quantile regression approach to generating prediction intervals	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						exponential smoothing; predictive distribution; empirical approach; quantile regression	TIME-SERIES; HOLT-WINTERS; FORECASTS	Exponential smoothing methods do not involve a formal procedure for identifying the underlying data generating process. The issue is then whether prediction intervals should be estimated by a theoretical approach, with the assumption that the method is optimal in some sense, or by an empirical procedure. Ln this paper we present an alternative hybrid approach which applies quantile regression to the empirical fit errors to produce forecast error quantile models. These models are functions of the lead time, as suggested by the theoretical variance expressions. Ln addition to avoiding the optimality assumption, the method is nonparametric, so there is no need for the common normality assumption. Application of the new approach to simple, Holt's, and damped Holt's exponential smoothing, using simulated and real data sets, gave encouraging results.

J	Myung, YS; Kim, HJ; Tcha, DW				Myung, YS; Kim, HJ; Tcha, DW			Design of communication networks with survivability constraints	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						survivable network design; integer programming; heuristics	CONNECTIVITY CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHM; CUTS	The rapid growth of telecommunication capacity, driven in part by the wide-ranging deployment of fiber-optic technology has led to increasing concern regarding the survivability of such networks. Ln communication networks, survivability is usually defined as the percentage of total traffic surviving some network failures in the worst case. Most of the survivable network design models proposed to date indirectly ensure network survivability by invoking a connectivity constraint, which calls for a prespecified number of paths between every distinct pair of nodes in the network. In this paper, we introduce a new network design model which directly addresses survivability in terms of a survivability constraint which specifies the allowable level of lost traffic during a network failure under prescribed conditions. The new model enables a network designer to consider a richer set of alternative network topologies than the existing connectivity models, and encompasses the connectivity models as special cases. The paper presents a procedure to compute link survivability, develops an integer programming formulation of the proposed survivability model, and discusses a special case of practical interest and its associated heuristic procedure. The proposed heuristic is tested on data from real-world problems as well as randomly generated problems.

Ln this paper, we describe a general framework for implementing dynamic routing and operational control mechanisms in Workflow Management Systems (WMSs). The framework consists of three techniques: workflow control tables, sequence constraints, and event-based workflow management rules. Our approach offers several unique features that are missing in. commercial workflow management systems: (1) it provides more flexibility in process modeling and control; (2) it permits rework on an ad hoc basis; (3) it handles exceptions to routing and operational controls; and (4) it exploits parallelism to increase system throughput and response time. Finally,the workflow management techniques are applied to the case of consumer loan management and compared with other approaches based on static routing.

We propose an unconventional model that deals with sequence-dependent setup costs in a multiple-machine environment. The sequence-splitting model splits an entire schedule into subsequences, leading to tractable subproblems.

J	Spearman, ML; Zhang, RQ				Spearman, ML; Zhang, RQ			Optimal lead time policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						scheduling; leadtime; serviceability; tardiness	JOB-SHOP; DUE-DATES; RULES	This paper examines two due-date setting problems first studied by Wein (1991). The first problem seeks to minimize the average due-date lead time (due-date minus arrival date) of jobs subject to a constraint on the fraction of tardy jobs (Problem I) while the second uses the same objective subject to a constraint on average job tardiness (Problem II). We show that under very general conditions, Problem I leads to unethical practice (i,e., quote lead times for which there is no hope to achieve when the system is highly congested) while Problem II results in policies that quote lead times that are monotonically increasing with the congestion level. Furthermore, we prove that Problem II is equivalent to a policy that is widely used and is easy to compute. This policy quotes lead times that guarantee the same serviceability level (the fraction of tardy jobs) to all jobs.

J	White, RE; Pearson, JN; Wilson, JR				White, RE; Pearson, JN; Wilson, JR			JIT manufacturing: A survey of implementations in small and large US manufacturers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						empirical study; Just-In-Time manufacturing; performance; manufacturer size; logistic regression	UNITED-STATES; TIME	Since the early 1980s, the diffusion of Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing from Japanese manufacturers to U.S. manufacturers has progressed at an accelerated rate. At this stage of the diffusion process, JIT implementations are more common and more advanced in large U.S. manufacturers than in small; consequently, U.S. businessmen's understanding of issues associated with JIT implementations in large manufacturers is more developed than that of small manufacturers. When small manufacturers represent about 96 percent of all U.S. manufacturers, investigation of JIT implementations in small, as well as large, manufacturers is warranted. This survey study investigates JIT implementation differences between small and large U.S. manufacturers. Ten management practices that constitute the JIT concept are used to examine implementation of JIT manufacturing systems. Odds ratio were constructed to determine if an association exists between implemented versus not implemented and manufacturer size for each JIT practice. Ten changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation are also assessed and examined in the study. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationships between implementation status of each of the JIT practices and of each of the changes in performance in small and large manufacturers. The results of the study show that the frequencies of the 10 JIT management practices implemented differ between the two groups of manufacturer size, and an association exists between the JIT practices implemented and manufacturer size. Moreover, the changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation vary, depending on implementation status of specific JIT management practices and manufacturer size.

We consider three situations. (1) a traditional model where there is no information to Be supplier prior to a demand to him except for past data; (2) the supplier knows the (s, S) policy used by the retailer as well. as the end-item demand distribution; and (3) the supplier has full information about the state of the retailer. Order up-to policies continue to be optimal for models with information flow for the finite horizon, the infinite horizon discounted and the infinite horizon average cost eases. Study of these three models enables us to understand the relationships between capacity, inventory,and information at the supplier level, as well as how they are affected by the retailer's (S - s) values and end-item. demand distribution. We estimate the savings at the supplier due to information flow and study when information is most beneficial.

J	Chatterjee, S; Singh, J				Chatterjee, S; Singh, J			Are tradeoffs inherent in diversification moves? A simultaneous model for type of diversification and mode of expansion decisions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						diversification; relatedness; mode of entry; resource based view	CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMATIC-RISK; STRATEGY; FIRMS; ACQUISITION; INVESTORS	Drawing on the premise that the diversification decisions are driven by antecedent factors such as a firm's existing resources (Teece 1982) and industry structural conditions, this paper develops formal hypotheses for reciprocity between the type of diversification and mode of expansion decisions. We consider the specificity of antecedent resources that affect these two decisions and conceptually demonstrate that there is a contradictory tension in trying to optimize the decisions jointly implying that one or both diversification decisions have to be sub-optimized (i.e., there has to be a trade-off). We make a conceptual argument that this sub-optimization is likely to be in the form of subordination of the mode decision subject to constraints imposed by resources that are highly specific to the mode decision. Following this,we empirically investigate this contradictory tension by using a simultaneous equation model (SEM) on a large sample of firms between 1981 and 1989. The results suggest that one antecedent factor-internal funds-act as the key mediating influence in the joint optimization and leads to a subordination of the mode decision in the joint optimization process. However, the existence of time compression economies and market power benefits are the exceptions to this subordination and trade off process.

J	Gawande, K; Wheeler, T				Gawande, K; Wheeler, T			Measures of effectiveness for governmental organizations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						measures of effectiveness; government agencies; Poisson models; missing data	MORAL HAZARD; PERFORMANCE	For organizations whose objective is not necessarily the maximization of a financial quantity, there is little written in the economics and management literature about methods that quantify their effectiveness. Potential users of such methodologies are typically governmental organizations and agencies to whom Congress allocates funding periodically, but may also include many nonprofit organizations. Such research is importantly needed because government is no longer making outlay allocations on a merely historical basis, but is using as a criterion how effectively an organization uses its resources in meeting its objectives. In this paper we analyze the Maritime Safety Program of the U.S. Coast: Guard (USCG), which is responsible for monitoring the quality of vessels that sail in U.S. waters, and present measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for the Program. We do this at two levels of activity: at an overall program level (Level I) and at a component activity level (Level II). Poisson models are used to construct the MOEs using data on maritime casualties (accidents) between 1990-1993 from the real-time Marine Safety Management System (MSMS) database maintained by the Coast Guard. A feature of the empirical methodology is the Bayesian imputation of missing data. The MOEs constructed here have at least four important uses. First, as the name suggests, they perform the function that financial quantities such as returns on equity or returns on sales perform for private-sector organizations-that is, they are indicators of efficiency. Second,they can be used as inputs into allocative decisions within the organization. For example, the Level II MOEs can be used as inputs into a programming problem that determines the optimal allocation of resources among component activities. Third, internal performance evaluation across USCG Programs or across Port Units (called Marine safety Offices) can be based on their respective Level I MOEs. Fourth, and possibly the most important long-run consideration, MOEs provide the basis for better regulation by the government. Without MOEs the nature of regulation is probably suboptimal. By adopting these MOEs as criteria, it will be easier for the government to redesign those aspects of its regulation of the Coast Guard which curtail incentives.

J	Tyagi, RK				Tyagi, RK			On the effects of downstream entry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						entry; vertical relationship; comparative-statics; oligopoly theory	COMPETITION; OLIGOPOLY; CHANNELS; NUMBER; PRICE	We study the effects of entry in a downstream market where firms (e.g., Compaq and IBM; CVS and Safeway) buy an input (e.g., microprocessor, grocery items) from an upstream supplier (e.g., Intel, Procter & Gamble) and sell their output to consumers. We show demand conditions where, contrary to conventional wisdom, entry of a new downstream firm lowers the downstream-market output and increases the consumer price. Thus consumers may be better off with fewer sellers in such markets. We also show that this entry may cause the profit of each incumbent downstream firm to: (i) remain unchanged; (ii) decrease; or (iii) even increase. Also, for a class of widely used demand conditions, the supplier's optimal price is shown invariant to the entry/exit of its downstream buyer firms. We classify all possible effects of downstream entry in terms of fundamental market demand conditions.

J	Wu, G; Gonzalez, R				Wu, G; Gonzalez, R			Nonlinear decision weights in choice under uncertainty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision making under uncertainty; prospect theory; decision weights; support theory	SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY; ANTICIPATED UTILITY; EXPECTED UTILITY; PROSPECT-THEORY; SUPPORT THEORY; RISK; REPRESENTATION; INDEPENDENCE; VIOLATIONS; AMBIGUITY	In most real-world decisions, consequences are tied explicitly to the outcome of events. Previous studies of decision making under uncertainty have indicated that the psychological weight attached to an event, called a decision weight, usually differs from the probability of that event. We investigate two sources of nonlinearity of decision weights: subadditivity of probability judgments, and the overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of medium and large probabilities. These two sources of nonlinearity are combined into a two-stage model of choice under uncertainty. In the first stage, events are taken into subjective probability judgments, and the second stage takes probability judgments into decision weights. We then characterize the curvature of the decision weights by extending a condition employed by Wu and Gonzalez (1996) in the domain of risk to the domain of uncertainty and show that the nonlinearity of decision weights can be decomposed into subadditivity of probability judgments and the curvature of the probability weighting function. Empirical tests support the proposed two-stage model and indicate that decision weights are concave then convex. More specifically, our results lend support for a new property of subjective probability judgments, interior additivity (subadditive at the boundaries, but additive away from the boundaries), and show that the probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped as in Wu and Gonzalez (1996).

Unlike other approaches to this problem, ours considers a transient situation. Thus, the flow line will typically contain work in process (WIP), that is, jobs that have been previously released to the system. Our goal is to develop a job release schedule that not only minimizes tardiness but also maximizes flexibility. The philosophy can be characterized as one that seeks to "release as late as possible, but no later!" Our methodology is based on Monte Carlo simulation and consequent optimization by a method that became known as "stochastic counterpart" or "sample path" simulation-based optimization techniques. We use this method to minimize an expected value objective function that contains terms for tardiness and flow time "costs." We include a discussion of how the cost parameters of this objective function can be obtained by considering a "characteristic curve" for the system. We also discuss means for obtaining sensitivity analysis with respect to due dates and service times distributions parameters. We conclude with a numerical example.

The efficiency of Decision Making Units is defined in the spirit of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), complemented with Decision Maker's preference information concerning the desirable structure of inputs and outputs. Our procedure begins by aiding the Decision Maker in searching for the most preferred combination of inputs and outputs of Decision Making Units (for short, Most Preferred Solution) which are efficient in DEA. Then, assuming that the Decision Maker's Most Preferred Solution maximizes his/her underlying (unknown) value function, we approximate the indifference contour of the value function at this point with its possible tangent hyperplanes. Value Efficiency scores are then calculated for each Decision Making Unit comparing the inefficient units to units having the same value as the Most Preferred Solution. The resulting Value Efficiency scores are optimistic approximations of the true scores. The procedure and the resulting efficiency scores are immediately applicable to solving practical problems.

This paper presents a simple method for scheduling these systems that performs well, not only with respect to mean waiting time, but also with respect to waiting-time variance and the outer percentiles of waiting time. The scheduling method is dynamic and uses the ages of items in each queue, as well as the queue statistics, to decide which queue to service next.

Currently, most models assume that processing times are independent. We consider the differences in behavior of workers in low- and high-inventory production lines. Using a laboratory experiment we show that workers speed up when they are the cause of idle time on the line. This means that processing time distributions are not independent of the size of the buffer, of the processing speed of co-workers, or of the amount of inventory in the system. We show that the direction of these effects is predictable and that the magnitude is significant. In particular, there is less idle time and higher output than would be predicted using assumptions of independence. in this experiment the effect completely canceled productivity loss due to blocking and starving. This work is important in understanding both the motivation of workers in low-inventory systems and the implications of models of manufacturing flow lines.

J	Ha, AY				Ha, AY			Incentive-compatible pricing for a service facility with joint production and congestion externalities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; incentive; delay cost; service facility; joint production; optimal design of queues	QUEUES	This paper considers the pricing problem of a service facility when services are jointly produced by the customers and the facility. Building on the work of Mendelson (1985), we model the facility as a GI / GI / 1 queue with customer-chosen service rates and linear delay costs. We show that the service rates chosen by the customers, based on their self-interest, are always suboptimal for the facility due to congestion externalities. We derive optimal incentive-compatible pricing schemes that can achieve optimal arrival rates and induce customers to choose optimal service rates. For the case of systemwide net-value maximization, we show that the optimal incentive-compatible pricing scheme consists of a variable fee that is proportional to the actual service time and a fixed rebate that is equal to a customer's expected delay cost in the queue. For the case of profit maximization of the facility, we show that the optimal pricing scheme again consists of a fixed fee and a variable fee. One insight from our analysis is that it may be appropriate for a service facility to reimburse each customer for his actual delay cost in the queue.

We develop a column generation technique that makes it possible to solve the huge linear programs that come up there. The technique, which we call Lagrangean pricing, is based on two different Lagrangean relaxations. We describe in detail the basic ingredients of our approach and give computational results for large-scale test data (with up to 70 million variables) from three German public transportation companies. Because of these results, we propose Lagrangean pricing as one of the basic ingredients of an effective-method to solve multiple-depot vehicle scheduling problems to proven optimality.

J	Gilbert, SM; Weng, ZK				Gilbert, SM; Weng, ZK			Incentive effects favor nonconsolidating queues in a service system: The principal-agent perspective	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						risk-pooling; capacity allocation; competitive equilibrium; incentives	DELIVERY-TIME COMPETITION; ENVIRONMENT	In this paper, we study a service network in which an agency is responsible for satisfying a constraint on the expected waiting and service time experienced by customers. However, the agency does not render the actual service. Instead, it serves to coordinate independently operated facilities. The coordinating agency must devise a strategy for allocating compensation and customers to the self-interested operators in order to minimize its own costs. For a network of two facilities, we model the facilities' self-interested capacity decisions as the solution to a game. Using this analytical framework, we compare two types of customer allocation: one from a common queue, and one from separate queues. Our analysis shows that it can be in the best interest of the coordinating agency to adopt a separate queue allocation scheme instead of one based on a common queue. Although doing so sacrifices risk-pooling benefits, these can be more than offset by the stronger incentives that are created for the independent facilities.

J	Hauser, JR				Hauser, JR			Research, development, and engineering metrics	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; research and development; product development; incentives	R-AND-D; PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; BUSINESS STRATEGY; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; TECHNOLOGY; EXPENDITURES; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; INCENTIVES	We seek to understand how the use of Research, Development, and Engineering (R,D&E) metrics can lead to more effective management of R,D&E. This paper combines qualitative and quantitative research to understand and improve the use of R,D&E metrics. Our research begins with interviews of 43 representative Chief Technical Officers, Chief Executive Offices, and researchers at 10 research-intensive international organizations. These interviews, and an extensive review of the literature, provide qualitative insights. Formal mathematical models attempt to explore these qualitative insights based on more general principles. Our research suggests that metrics-based evaluation and management vary according to the characteristics of the R,D&E activity. For applied projects, we find that project selection can be based on market-outcome metrics when firms use central subsidies to account for short-termism, risk aversion, and scope. With an efficient form of subsidies known as "tin-cupping," the business units have the incentives to choose the projects that are in the firm's best long-term interests. For core-technological development, longer time delays and more risky programs imply that popular R,D&E effectiveness metrics lead researchers to select programs that are not in the firm's long-term interest. Our analyses suggest that firms moderate such market-outcome metrics by placing a larger weight on metrics that attempt to measure research effort more directly. These metrics include standard measures such as publications, citations, patents, citations to patents, and peer review. For basic research, the issues shift to getting the right people and encouraging a breadth of ideas. Unfortunately, metrics that identify the "best people" based on research success lead directly to "not-invented-here'' behaviors. Such behaviors result in research empires that are larger than necessary, but lead to fewer ideas.

J	Smith, JE				Smith, JE			Evaluating income streams: A decision analysis approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision analysis; temporal resolution of uncertainty; risk profiles	CONSUMPTION DECISIONS; INDUCED PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY; RESOLUTION; CHOICE	Most important decision problems-virtually all capital investments and planning situations-involve risky cash flow with uncertainties that are resolved over time. In most of these problems, the decision-maker has access to financial markets and may barrow and lend to smooth consumption over time. Yet, because of the difficulty of incorporating these borrowing and lending decisions into the evaluation models, these opportunities are rarely explicitly modeled in decision and risk analyses of these investments. In this paper, we study the errors induced by failing to account for these borrowing and lending decisions, and we develop extensions to the standard decision and risk analysis procedures that, given certain market and preference assumptions, take these borrowing and lending opportunities into account without overburdening the evaluation models.

J	Damerdji, H; Glynn, PW				Damerdji, H; Glynn, PW			Limit theory for performance modeling of future event set algorithms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; future event set; performance evaluation; linked list; indexed list; interaction hold model; Harris chain	SIMULATION; HEAPSORT	In a discrete-event simulation, the information related to the events scheduled to occur in the future is kept in a data structure called the future event set (FES). In this paper, we study the interaction hold model, a popular stochastic model for FES performance analysis, corresponding to the superposition of a (fixed) number of renewal processes; The general state-space Markov chain formed by the discrete-time process that keeps track, at event times, of the residual lifetimes is shown here to be recurrent in the sense of Harris, and its stationary distribution is obtained. Linked lists and indexed lists, two popular FESs, are investigated using this model. For the interaction hold model, we make rigorous certain published results as well as introduce new ones. For example, we derive the distribution of the relative position of the event to be inserted in the data structure. In the exponential case, our analytic and empirical results confirm that when events with relatively short lifetimes often get regenerated upon their occurrence, it is better to scan a list (or sublist) from its head rather than tail. In the same context and for indexed lists with sublists with constant sizes, our results suggest that subsequent sublists should be of larger sizes, i.e., the first sublist should contain the smallest number of records, the second sublist the second smallest number of records, etc.	N Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Engn Econ Syst & Operat Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA	Damerdji, H (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.

Even under this assumption, much of the work to date has focused on the unconstrained optimization of the system, in which a penalty cost for unsatisfied demand is assigned. The literature on constrained optimization, wherein a service level requirement needs to be met, is more sparse. In this paper, we consider the constrained optimization problem, where orders are allowed to cross in time. We propose a feasible directions procedure that is simulation based, and present computational results for a large number of test cases. In the vast majority of cases,we come within 5% of estimated optimality.

J	Chen, FR				Chen, FR			Echelon reorder points, installation reorder points, and the value of centralized demand information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; stochastic demand; batch ordering; centralized information; electronic data interchange	STOCHASTIC INVENTORY SYSTEMS; POLICIES	We consider a serial inventory system with N stages. The material flows from an outside supplier to stage N, then to stage N - 1, etc., and finally to stage 1 where random customer demand arises. Each stage replenishes a stage-specific inventory position according to a stage-specific reorder point/order quantity policy. Two variations of this policy are considered. One is based on echelon stock, and the other installation stock. The former requires centralized demand information, while the latter does not. The relative cost difference between the two policies is called the value of centralized demand information. For fixed order quantities, we develop efficient algorithms for computing both the optimal echelon reorder points and the optimal installation reorder points. These algorithms enable us to conduct an extensive computational study to assess the value of centralized demand information and to understand how this value depends on several key system parameters, i.e., the number of stages, leadtimes, batch sizes, demand variability, and the desired level of customer service.

J	Christensen, CM; Suarez, FF; Utterback, JM				Christensen, CM; Suarez, FF; Utterback, JM			Strategies for survival in fast-changing industries	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						dominant designs; innovation; standards; disk drives; strategy; technology	TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; FIRMS; INNOVATION; FAILURE; ENTRY	Technology strategy variables tend to predominate as predictors of survival in the fast-changing rigid disk drive industry. Building on these previous studies, we here test the hypothesis that the technological and market strategies of a new entrant are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays an important role in a firm's probability of survival. In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival. This paper advances the existing literature on innovation by tracing the main technical elements of a dominant design in the rigid disk drive industry over time, and provides a much more rigorous definition of the concept of a dominant design than we have had in the past.

J	Ho, TH; Tang, CS; Bell, DR				Ho, TH; Tang, CS; Bell, DR			Rational shopping behavior and the option value of variable pricing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						rational shopping; EDLP; HILO; retail pricing format	PURCHASE BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTIONS; IMPACT	When a product's price fluctuates at a store, how should rational, cost-minimizing shoppers shop for it? Specifically, how frequently should they visit the store, and how much of the product should they buy when they get there? Would this rational shopping behavior differ across Every Day Low Price (EDLP) and Promotional Pricing (HILO) stores? If shoppers are rational, which retail price format is more profitable, EDLP or HILO? To answer these questions, we develop a normative model that shows how rational customers should shop when the price of the product is random. We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal purchasing policy and show that the optimal quantity to purchase under a given price scenario is linearly decreasing in the difference between the price under that scenario and the average price. This purchase flexibility due to price variability has a direct impact on shopping frequency. Indeed, the benefit of this purchase flexibility can be captured via an "option value" that implicitly reduces the fixed cost associated with each shopping trip. Consequently, rational shoppers should shop more often and buy fewer units per trip when they face higher price variability. Our results suggest that if two stores charge the same average price for a product, rational shoppers incur a lower level of expenditure at the store with a higher price variability. Since stores with different price variabilities coexist in practice, we expect stores with higher price variability to charge a higher average price. Thus, given two stores, a higher relative mean price for a given item should be indicative of higher price variability, and vice versa. These model implications are tested using multicategory scanner panel data from 513 households and pricing data for three stores (two EDLP stores ana one HILO store) and 33 product categories over a two-year period. We find strong empirical support for the model implications.

I We decompose accounting earnings into permanent and transitory components and postulate that dividend policy is driven by sustainable permanent earnings. Two measures of permanent earnings are proposed. The first is a permanent earnings variable extracted from accounting earnings by a random-level shift ARMA model. The second measure is stock price times cost of capital. These two permanent earnings measures are employed in the Marsh-Merton (1987) model to explain corporate dividend behavior and their performance is compared. A generalized friction method is adopted for empirical estimation to account for stepwise dividend movements over time. Results show that the permanent earnings measure extracted from accounting earnings data explains dividend dynamic behavior better than stock price.

In GMAP, an object may be required to be duplicated in multiple locations. We develop a Lagrangian dual ascent algorithm for GMAP. This dual ascent and the subgradient search each possess advantages that can be combined to develop a new Lagrangian dual search algorithm. The latter algorithm,when incorporated into a branch-and-bound algorithm as the lower bounding scheme, can accelerate the search process. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this branch-and-bound algorithm not only for GMAPs, but for GAPs that are more difficult than could be solved by previous algorithms.

This paper provides a method that delivers both high quality solutions and firm measures of that quality, and allows problems to be solved in reasonable time on a desktop computer. The approach begins with a previously proposed tight linear programming formulation and uses subgradient optimization on a lagrangian relaxation of the model. However, to dramatically improve the performance of this approach, we augment a subproblem of the lagrangian relaxation model with a cut constraint. In computational experiments on eighty-four standard test problems, average gaps are 0.048%. Maximum gaps are under 1% while average solution times on a Pentium-166 are under five minutes.

J	Swaminathan, JM; Tayur, SR				Swaminathan, JM; Tayur, SR			Managing broader product lines through delayed differentiation using vanilla boxes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic multi-product assembly systems; product variety; component commonality; demand correlation; inventory management; stochastic integer programs	COMPONENT COMMONALITY; INVENTORY MODEL; SAFETY STOCK	In an attempt to reduce cost while maintaining good customer service, some of the leading manufacturers in the computer industry are delaying product differentiation (by exploiting component commonality) while managing broader product lines. In an environment where demands are stochastic, it seems a good strategy to store inventory in the form of semi-finished products (vanilla boxes) that can serve more than one final product. However, finding the optimal configurations and inventory levels of the vanilla boxes could be a challenging task. In this paper, we model the above problem as a two-stage integer program with recourse. By utilizing structural decomposition of the problem and (sub)gradient derivative methods, we provide an effective solution procedure. A special case, a variant, and several extensions are also discussed. In our computational section, we utilize our model to study several new research issues. We provide insights on the effect of demand variance, correlation, and capacity limitations on the optimal configuration and inventory levels of vanilla boxes and the performance of a vanilla assembly process. In addition, we compare the performance of the vanilla assembly process to make-to-stock and assemble-to-order processes and provide managerial insights on the conditions under which one might be better than the others. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of an IBM product line (which motivated this work) and the effectiveness of a heuristic tailored for that application.

J	Xie, JH; Song, XM; Stringfellow, A				Xie, JH; Song, XM; Stringfellow, A			Interfunctional conflict, conflict resolution styles, and new product success: A four-culture comparison	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; conflict management; cross-function integration; cross-cultural study	R-AND-D; DEVILS ADVOCACY; JAPANESE; CONSENSUS; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	This paper develops a model relating innovation success to the level of interfunctional conflict and conflict resolution methods. The model suggests a concave relationship between performance and the level of interfunctional conflict among marketing, R&D, and manufacturing. It also conjectures that both national culture and the level of interfunctional conflict influence the effectiveness of different conflict resolution methods.-An empirical test of the proposed framework involves a survey of 968 marketing managers from Japan, I-long Kong, the United States, and Great Britain. The results provide general support for the model's predictions and reveal several significant cross-national differences.

J	Yi, W; Bier, VM				Yi, W; Bier, VM			An application of copulas to accident precursor analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						copulas; accident precursors; risk analysis; dependencies; Bayesian analysis	BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS; EXPERT OPINIONS; INFORMATION; FREQUENCY; RISK	Data on accident precursors can help in estimating accident frequencies, since they provide a rich source of information on intersystem dependencies. However, Bayesian analysis of accident precursors requires the ability to construct joint prior distributions reflecting such dependencies. For example, the failure probabilities of a particular safety system under normal and accident conditions, respectively, will generally not be identical (because of the effects of the accident), but will almost certainly be correlated (since both failure probabilities reflect the performance of the same components, with the same inherent levels of reliability). In this paper, we explore the use of copulas (a method of representing joint distribution functions with particular marginals) to construct the needed prior distributions, and then use these distributions in a Bayesian analysis of hypothetical precursor data. This demonstrates the usefulness of copulas in practice. The same approach can also be used in a wide variety of other contexts where joint distributions with particular marginals are desired.

J	Hatch, NW; Mowery, DC				Hatch, NW; Mowery, DC			Process innovation and learning by doing in semiconductor manufacturing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process technology development; process technology transfer; learning curves	CURVE; INDUSTRY	This payer analyzes the relationship between process innovation and learning by doing in the semiconductor industry where improvements in manufacturing yield are a catalyst for dynamic cost reductions. In contrast to most previous studies of learning by doing, the learning curve is shown here to be the product of deliberate activities intended to improve yields and reduce costs, rather than the incidental byproduct of production volume. Since some of the knowledge acquired through learning by doing during new process development is specific to the production environment where the process is developed, some knowledge is effectively lost when a new process is transferred to manufacturing. We find that dedicated process development facilities, geographic proximity between development and manufacturing facilities, and the duplication of equipment between development and manufacturing facilities are all significant in improving performance in introducing new technologies. Once in manufacturing, new processes are shown to disrupt the ongoing learning activities of existing processes by drawing away scarce engineering resources to "debug" the new processes.

A flexible split-hazard specification that allows for individual-level differences in both the long-run probability of eventual relapse and the short-run timing of relapse is developed. The model is applied to a comprehensive data set involving individual drug abuse and treatment histories for over 800 addicts. Our findings indicate (1) that the short-run success of methadone programs does not automatically translate into long-run abstinence, which suggests the need for aftercare, (2) the value of preventing a teenager or young adult from initiating, and (3) the possibility of identifying high-risk groups, both in terms of age of first daily use and in terms of ethnicity.

J	Henderson, N; Langford, I				Henderson, N; Langford, I			Cross-disciplinary evidence for hyperbolic social discount rates	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						social discount rate; hyperbolic discounting; benefit-cost analysis	PREFERENCE REVERSAL; IMPULSE CONTROL; SELF-CONTROL; RATE POLICY; CHOICE; REWARD	Researchers in different disciplines have independently found evidence to suggest that the social discount rate may be hyperbolic, rather than exponential, in nature. Both behaviorist research and some empirical economics studies support the hyperbolic discounting hypothesis. U.S. and U.K. government discounting dispensations for some long-run public development projects are explicable in terms of an underlying hyperbolic social discount rate. A statistical aggregation argument demonstrates that even if the behaviorist, economics and public choice evidence for hyperbolic discounting is not conclusive, the social discount rate of a set of people who individually express time preferences best modeled by exponential discounting functions is nonetheless hyperbolic. Further empirical economics studies of discounting preferences are required. Comparisons of different national discounting practices would also be useful to see how widespread is the use of unusually low exponential rates of discount for long-run projects. The application of hyperbolic discounting would have most impact in long-run benefit-cost analyses. However, government agencies would require overwhelming evidence before switching from exponential to hyperbolic discounting.

These coupons therefore have the ability to link consumer purchases across different brands as well as shopping trips. We model the effects of cross-ruff coupons on consumer choice behavior and derive the conditions under which cross-ruff coupons can lead to higher sales and profits than other types of package coupons. The model also provides insights into the selection of appropriate carrier and target brands, and on how the choice of an appropriate carrier or a target brand is affected when the categories that these brands belong to are demand complements or substitutes. We conduct an empirical analysis using data from 195 different cross-ruff coupon campaigns observed in grocery stores in a major U.S. city over a three-month period. The data are consistent with the key insights provided by the model.

J	Li, G; Rajagopalan, S				Li, G; Rajagopalan, S			Process improvement, quality, and learning effects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality improvement; process improvement; learning effects; quality costs; productivity	CURVES	While quality has attracted significant attention in the past two decades, the debate is still on as to whether a firm should aim for zero defects or base its quality decisions on cost-benefit trade-offs. The continuous improvement advocates generally eschew the cost trade-off approach, but U.S, firms, after spending substantial sums on quality-related activities in the 1980s, appear to be focusing again on cost trade-offs and measures such as return on quality. This payer provides analytical support for the continuous improvement argument while relying on a cost trade-off analysis. We present a dynamic model of a monopolist making decisions on price, production, process improvement, and quality assurance efforts. The model is comprehensive and captures the effects of autonomous and induced learning on both productivity and quality and incorporates quality related costs in detail. Using this model, we show that quality improves over time, while process improvement effort and quality assurance effort decrease over time. In fact, as anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests, process improvement and quality assurance effort is high when quality level is low, and vice-versa. The optimal production rate is increasing and the optimal price is decreasing over time. We also provide valuable insights into the impact of changes in key parameters such as interest rates on production, price, process improvement effort, and quality assurance effort.

J	Besanko, D; Gupta, S; Jain, D				Besanko, D; Gupta, S; Jain, D			Logit demand estimation under competitive pricing behavior: An equilibrium framework	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						demand estimation; logit; endogeneity; competitive strategy	MODELS; RETAILER	Discrete choice models of demand have typically been estimated assuming that prices are exogenous. Since unobservable (to the researcher) product attributes, such as coupon availability, may impact consumer utility as well as price setting by firms, we treat prices as endogenous. Specifically, prices are assumed to be the equilibrium outcomes of Nash competition among manufacturers and retailers. To empirically validate the assumptions, we estimate logit demand systems jointly with equilibrium pricing equations for two product categories using retail scanner data and cost data on factor prices. In each category, we find statistical evidence of price endogeneity. We also find that the estimates of the price response parameter and the brand-specific constants are generally biased downward when the endogeneity of prices is ignored. Our framework provides explicit estimates of the value created by a brand, i.e., the difference between consumers' willingness to pay for a brand and its cost of production.

J	Lambrecht, MR; Ivens, PL; Vandaele, NJ				Lambrecht, MR; Ivens, PL; Vandaele, NJ			ACLIPS: A capacity and lead time integrated procedure for scheduling	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queueing networks; leadtime estimation; lot size; multimachine scheduling	SHIFTING BOTTLENECK PROCEDURE; DYNAMIC JOB SHOPS; APPROXIMATIONS; ALGORITHM; MODELS	We propose a general hierarchical procedure to address real-life job shop scheduling problems. The shop typically produces a variety of products, each with its own arrival stream, its own route through the shop and a given customer due date. The procedure first determines the manufacturing lot sizes for each product. The objective is to minimize the expected lead time, and therefore we model the production environment as a queueing network. Given these lead times, release dates are set dynamically. This in turn creates a time window for every manufacturing order in which the various operations have to be sequenced. The sequencing logic is based on an Extended Shifting Bottleneck Procedure. These three major decisions are next incorporated into a four-phase, hierarchical, operational implementation scheme. A small numerical example is used to illustrate the methodology. The final objective however is to develop a procedure that is useful for large, real-life shops. We therefore report on a real-life application.

Each retailer faces a constant, retailer specific, demand rate and inventory holding cost is charged at the retailers and the warehouses. We show that, in an effective strategy which minimizes the asymptotic long run average cost, each warehouse receives fully loaded trucks from the vendor but never holds inventory. That is, each warehouse serves only as a coordinator of the frequency, time and sizes of deliveries to the retailers. This insight is used to construct an inventory control policy and vehicle routing strategy for multi-echelon distribution systems. Computational results are also reported.

J	Talluri, K; van Ryzin, G				Talluri, K; van Ryzin, G			An analysis of bid-price controls for network revenue management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bid prices; optimality; yield management; revenue management; airlines; dynamic programming; heuristics; asymptotic analysis	SEAT INVENTORY CONTROL; YIELD MANAGEMENT; FARE CLASSES; MODEL; ALLOCATION; AIRLINES	Bid-prices are becoming an increasingly popular method for controlling the sale of inventory in revenue management applications. In this form of control, threshold-or "bid"-prices are set for the resources or units of inventory (seats on flight legs, hotel rooms on specific dates, etc.) and a product (a seat in a fare class on an itinerary or room for a sequence of dates) is sold only if the offered fare exceeds the sum of the threshold prices of all the resources needed to supply the product. This approach is appealing on intuitive and practical grounds, but the theory underlying it is not well developed. Moreover, the extent to which bid-price controls represent optimal or near optimal policies is not well understood. Using a general model of the demand process, we show that bid-price control is not optimal in general and analyze why bid-price schemes can fail to produce correct accept/deny decisions. However, we prove that when leg capacities and sales volumes are large, bid-price controls are asymptotically optimal, provided the right bid prices are used. We also provide analytical upper bounds on the optimal revenue. In addition, we analyze properties of the asymptotically optimal bid prices. For example, we show they are constant over time, even when demand is nonstationary, and that they may not be unique.

Under very general assumptions, when a zero-coupon bond of maturity T exists, the dynamic efficient frontier is a straight line, the slope of which is explicitly characterized. Every dynamic mean-variance efficient strategy can be viewed as buy and hold combinations of two funds: the zero-coupon bond of maturity T and a continuously rebalanced portfolio. An appropriate dynamic strategy defining the latter is explicitly derived for two particular price processes and comparisons of the Efficient Frontiers (Static versus Dynamic) are provided in these cases.

J	Bhattacharya, S; Krishnan, V; Mahajan, V				Bhattacharya, S; Krishnan, V; Mahajan, V			Managing new product definition in highly dynamic environments	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; product definition; dynamic environments		In highly dynamic environments, characterized by changing customer preferences and uncertainty about competitive products, managing the development of a new product is a complex managerial task. The traditional practice, recommended in the literature, of reaching a sharp definition early in the new product development (NPD) process may not be optimal, desirable or even feasible in such dynamic situations. Under high uncertainty, forcing early finalization of specifications may result in a firm getting locked into an incorrect definition. Based on our study of NPD in the high technology industry, we present a model of an approach called real-time definition, in which a firm adapts its product definition process to the market and competitive environment. Uncertainty in the product definition is resolved through frequent, repeated interactions with customers and using a flexible development process. We find that early definition is optimal only in a limited set of situations. To maximize its anticipated profits, a firm should tune its definition process to the prevailing level of market uncertainty, the marginal value of information obtained from the customer during the NPD process, and its own risk-profile and internal development capabilities. Effects of competition on a firm's definition approach are also examined, and implications for managers of a NPD process are presented using a conceptual framework.

J	Desai, P; Purohit, D				Desai, P; Purohit, D			Leasing and selling: Optimal marketing strategies for a durable goods firm	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						leasing; selling; durable goods; automobiles	MONOPOLY; SALES	This paper analyzes the problems associated with marketing a durable through leases and sales. Academic research in this area has argued that in a monopolistic environment, leasing dominates selling. Hence, leasing and selling should not co-exist and the firm should concentrate its efforts solely on leasing. We show that the relative profitability of leasing and selling hinges on the rates at which leased and sold units depreciate. In particular, we find that leasing does not dominate selling in all cases; if sold units depreciate at a significantly higher rate than leased units, a monopolistic firm is better off by only selling its product. In addition, we find that if leaded and sold products depreciate at different rates, then the optimal strategy for the firm involves a combination of both leasing and selling. We conclude the paper with an empirical analysis of the depreciation rates of leased and sold units of a popular car model. We find that the depreciation rate of leased cars has been significantly lower than the depreciation rate of sold cars.

We show that the expected number of customers in the system during peak congestion can be closely approximated by (lambda + A)/mu for service distributions with coefficient of variation between 0 and 1. Motivated by a result derived by Eick, Massey, and Whitt that the time lag of the peak congestion from the peak of the customer arrivals is 1/2 mu for models with deterministic service times, we show that the time lag for exponential service times is closely approximated by 1/mu. Based on a cycle length of 24 hours and regardless of the values of other system parameters, these approximations are of the order of 1% accuracy for mu = 1, and the accuracy increases rapidly with increasing mu.

J	Laguna, M				Laguna, M			Applying robust optimization to capacity expansion of one location in telecommunications with demand uncertainty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity expansion; robust optimization; time-dependent knapsack problem	STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS	The problem of expanding the capacity of a single facility in telecommunications network planning is addressed. This problem can be formulated as a time-dependent knapsack, when relevant information is assumed to be known. We introduce the use of scenarios to model uncertainty in key data. The problem is formulated within the robust optimization framework and solved exactly in two phases. The first phase consists of a dynamic programming recursion and the second one of a shortest path procedure. Experiments show that a large number of scenarios can be handled with this technique, because computational times are more sensitive to the maximum demand across all scenarios than to the number of scenarios considered. A user-interface based on Microsoft Excel is developed as a decision support system for network planners.

J	Mukherjee, AS; Lapre, MA; Van Wassenhove, LN				Mukherjee, AS; Lapre, MA; Van Wassenhove, LN			Knowledge driven quality improvement	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality; organizational learning; technological knowledge; learning by experimentation	MANAGEMENT	Little is known about the processes that make TQM effective. Why are some quality improvement projects more effective than others? We argue that TQM processes affect the way people create new knowledge, which in turn determines organizational effectiveness. We explore this by studying 62 quality improvement projects undertaken in one factory over a decade. Using a factor analysis we identify three learning constructs that characterize the learning process: scope, conceptual learning, and operational learning. We use OLS regressions to study the impact of these learning constructs on project performance. Conceptual and operational learning are found to play a crucial role in achieving goals, creating new technological knowledge, and changing factory personnel's attention. Contrary to the common practice of relying on operational learning, we suggest the application of conceptual learning as well, particularly if the technology is poorly understood. It facilitates the codification of knowledge, which enhances its dissemination for both present and future use.

J	Murthy, I; Sarkar, S				Murthy, I; Sarkar, S			Stochastic shortest path problems with piecewise-linear concave utility functions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic; shortest path; networks	REPLACEMENT; NETWORKS	This paper considers a stochastic shortest path problem where the are lengths are independent random variables following a normal distribution. In this problem, the optimal path is one that maximizes the expected utility, with the utility function being piecewise-linear and concave. Such a utility function can be used to approximate nonlinear utility functions that capture risk averse behaviour for a wide class of problems. The principal contribution of this paper is the development of exact algorithms to solve large problem instances. Two algorithms are developed and incorporated in labelling procedures. Computational testing is done to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Overall, both algorithms are very effective in solving large problems quickly. The relative performance of the two algorithms is found to depend on the "curvature" of the piecewise linear utility function.

We provide properties of the optimal solution and relate them to the approach of using a single source as advocated by TIT. The solution procedure provides the periodic order quantity from each supplier; the order size; and the firm cycle time as well as how many times per cycle we should order from each supplier. We show that the maximum error of our solution can be made as small as desired.

J	Sikora, R; Shaw, MJ				Sikora, R; Shaw, MJ			A multi-agent framework for the coordination and integration of information systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						system integration; coordination theory; intelligent manufacturing; intelligent agents; distributed information systems; enterprise integration	CAPACITATED FLOW LINE; SUPPORT; NEGOTIATION; KNOWLEDGE; SEMANTICS; ALGORITHM	This paper describes a framework for the coordination and integration of information systems. By modeling typical enterprise information systems as consisting of multiple agents with different functionalities, the methodology provides the representational formalism, coordination mechanisms, and control schemes necessary for integrating heterogeneous units of an information system while meeting such performance criteria as overall effectiveness, efficiency, responsiveness, and robustness. The framework is applied to the development of a manufacturing information system for managing the production processes for making printed circuit boards. Performance results confirm that the system integration framework is important to support complex business processes that involve multiple steps of activities processed by a group of agents across a variety of functionalities.

J	Van den Bulte, C; Moenaert, RK				Van den Bulte, C; Moenaert, RK			The effects of R&D team co-location on communication patterns among R&D, marketing, and manufacturing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; co-location; R&D-marketing interface; social networks	DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; DIRECTED-GRAPHS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; ANTECEDENTS; MODELS; DESIGN; FIELD	Reducing the physical distance among R&D engineers and between R&D and marketing is widely believed to result in more frequent communication, and hence higher product development performance. However, the empirical evidence for the effect of co-location on communication frequency is problematic for two reasons: (I)the evidence often features either little contextual realism or doubtful internal validity, and (2) the analysis does not deal with the statistical problems typical of network data. Our study avoids the first problem by using sequential network data collected from a quasi-experiment at an industrial company that regrouped its R&D teams into a new facility. We avoid the second problem by using Wasserman and Iacobucci's (1988) method for the statistical analysis of sequential network data. Our results show that communication among R&D teams was enhanced after co-locating these teams. Surprisingly, communication frequency between R&D and marketing was not affected by the increased physical distance. This may suggest that business procedures accompanying the relocation prevented a widening gap between R&D and marketing. Alternatively, it may indicate that the effect of co-location depends on the content and medium of the communication flows.

J	Young, MR; Lenk, PJ				Young, MR; Lenk, PJ			Hierarchical Bayes methods for multifactor model estimation and portfolio selection	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						beta; estimation risk; Markov chain Monte Carlo; sensitivity; shrinkage	GIBBS SAMPLER; MONTE-CARLO; RISK; SENSITIVITY	The factor model is an important construct for both portfolio managers and researchers in modern finance. For practitioners, factor model coefficients are used to guide the construction of optimal portfolios. For academicians, factor model parameters play a fundamental role in explaining equilibrium asset prices and other market phenomena. This paper presents a hierarchical modeling procedure that can substantially improve the accuracy of factor model parameter estimates through incorporation of cross-sectional information. It is shown that this improvement in parameter estimation accuracy translates into substantial improvement in portfolio performance. Expressions are derived that characterize the sensitivity of portfolio performance to parameter estimation error. Evidence with NYSE data suggests that the hierarchical estimation technique leads to superior out-of-sample portfolio performance when compared to alternative estimation approaches.

J	Nault, BR				Nault, BR			Information technology and organization design: Locating decisions and information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						centralization/decentralization; collocation; decision rights; information asymmetry; network externalities; organizational form	MARKETS	We study the impact of information technology (IT) on the profitability of individual organization designs and on the relative profitability of different organization designs. We develop models where organization design is defined by the location of investment decision authority. We consider global and local investment when there is an information asymmetry between a central authority and decentralized nodes-decentralized nodes make better local investment decisions because of their local knowledge. We define three separate organization designs: a hierarchy where all investments are made by a central authority, a market where all investments are made by the decentralized nodes, and a mixed mode where global investments are made by a central authority and local investments are made by decentralized nodes. Because of complementarities between global and local investment, we show that there is underinvestment relative to first-best in all three organization designs. We also find that IT can be used to mitigate that underinvestment, either by bringing information to the decision maker or by redesigning the monitoring and incentive structure. We demonstrate that IT does not necessarily favor decentralized organization designs, and we show how the costs of coordination may result in the mixed mode being dominated by one or both of the alternative organization designs. Thus, collocation of investment decision rights and information that results in decisions that require coordination might not be optimal when the costs of not synchronizing global and local investment are high.

The study was a large effort in which over 200 military experts participated for more than one year. We developed a Value-Focused Thinking model, which we used to evaluate which futuristic system concepts have the greatest potential to ensure future U.S. air and space dominance. We named the value model Foundations 2025 because it represented a return to the basics of air and space dominance. We used the "silver standard" approach for value hierarchy development. The participants identified key verbs to describe tasks that must be performed in 2025 to ensure air and space dominance. The value hierarchy was developed bottom-up by aggregating these verbs into higher order tasks using affinity diagrams. Using the value hierarchy, we used multiattribute decision analysis techniques to develop an additive value model with 134 attributes. The Foundations 2025 value model was successfully used to score 43 futuristic system concepts and provide insights about the most promising system concepts and technologies. The analysis results directly supported the study director and the senior leadership of the United States Air Force.

J	Lin, CR; Buongiorno, J				Lin, CR; Buongiorno, J			Tree diversity, landscape diversity, and economics of maple-birch forests: Implications of Markovian models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ecosystem management; forestry; optimization; risk; simulation	NORTHERN HARDWOOD STANDS; SIZE DIVERSITY; GROWTH-MODEL; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; RETURNS	Markov decision process (MDP) models were effective in analyzing forest management policies. Even the simplest standard results gave useful insights into forest ecology, such as how landscape diversity is shaped by natural catastrophes, and how forests mature through successional phases. The methods were also useful to predict the effects of different management policies on ecological and economic criteria. Optimization augmented the usefulness of the approach, suggesting that income from Wisconsin's maple-birch forests could be increased without ruining their diversity of landscape, tree size, and tree species. It showed that maximizing species diversity, defined by the distribution of trees in shade-tolerance classes, would require some harvest. Instead, maximum tree size diversity occurred in unmanaged forests, but this gave a less diverse landscape and no income. The MDP method allowed for the design of compromise policies that would maximize income while keeping diversity above specified limits. The opportunity cost of increasing tree size diversity was found to be much higher than for species diversity. Comparing the maximum timber income owners could have got with what they actually cut suggested that the amenity value of forests was four times that of timber. Advantages of the methods reside in the ability to model complex ecosystem processes with simple probability matrices, and in the rich MDP theory and algorithms. Limitations include the difficulty of defining a space set large enough for accurate discretization, but small enough for practical application.

Items that are classified as conforming may be nonconforming, resulting in a poor outgoing quality level. Items that are classified as nonconforming may be conforming, resulting in excessive scrapping of conforming items. The failed items are commonly retested to reduce the scrapping problem. Alternatively, the accepted items may be retested to improve outgoing quality. In this paper, we examine the question of whether it is better to repetitively test rejected items, or to repetitively test accepted items. We also examine the relationship between the two testing policies, testing equipment accuracy and capacity, incoming quality, and outgoing quality requirements.

J	Dey, D; Sarkar, S; De, P				Dey, D; Sarkar, S; De, P			A probabilistic decision model for entity matching in heterogeneous databases	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						semantic heterogeneity; matching under uncertainty; classification costs; assignment problem	RECORD LINKAGE; INTEGRATION	In recent years, there has been a proliferation of database systems in all types of organizations. In many cases, these databases are developed in different departments and maintained autonomously. Much is to be gained, however, if databases across departments, divisions, or even organizations can be related to one another. One main problem of relating data stored in different databases is the differences in their representation of real-world entities, such as the use of different identifiers or primary keys. We present a decision theoretic model for matching entities across different databases. The decision to match two entities from two different databases inherently involves some uncertainty since an exact match may not be found because of errors in data collection, data entry, and data representation. We model this uncertainty using probability theory and propose an integer programming formulation that minimizes the total cost associated with the entity matching decision. The model has been implemented and validated on real-world data.

Our results show that a linear price response function as is often used in empirical research, in conjunction with the typical concavity assumed in a large range of marketing response functions, would yield an interior equilibrium solution. We then consider the optimal reactions on pricing and marketing spending to entry and potential market expansion. In the context of the MNL models, we demonstrate that the entry of a new brand evokes a decrease in the equilibrium prices of the existing brands as a defensive reaction. This is true in both an expanding market as well as a fixed market. However, while new entry into a fixed market would trigger the incumbents to lower the marketing expenditure, we show that firms tend to raise marketing activities as they experience market expansion. Consequently, there exist distinct possibilities that marketing efforts for the existing brands increase in view of entry in an expanding market.

J	Vanderbeck, F				Vanderbeck, F			Lot-sizing with start-up times	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							SCHEDULING PROBLEM; COLUMN GENERATION; SETUP TIMES; ALGORITHM; COMPLEXITY; COSTS	Many practical applications of lot-sizing and scheduling problems involve start-up times. Operations research literature contains but few studies of lot-sizing models that take start-up times explicitly into account. Here, we review some of these studies, discuss the models and their complexity, and we propose further models. We consider in particular a single-stage single-mode multi-item lot-sizing model with continuous set-ups and sequence independent start-up times, which we solve using an integer programming column generation algorithm and we develop a dynamic programming procedure for the single-item subproblem that treats the initial stock as a decision variable. We also use cutting planes developed by Constantino for the multiitem polyhedra. By combining column and cut generation, the lower bounds that we obtain before branching are on average less than 2% from an optimal solution. Our algorithm solves instances with 3 to 5 items and 24 periods in an average of 50 seconds on a modern workstation, and problems with 36 periods in an average of 750 seconds. Solutions guaranteed to be within 2% of optimality are obtained in less than 75% of these times.

We develop readily verifiable conditions for the applicability of this method. Our conditions mainly place restrictions on the basic building blocks (i.e., the transition probabilities, the distribution and density functions of the event lifetimes, and the initial distribution) of the GSMP, which is in contrast to the structural conditions needed for infinitesimal perturbation analysis. We explicitly show that our conditions hold in many practical settings, and in particular, for large classes of queueing and reliability models. One intermediate result we obtain in this study, which is of independent value, is to formally show that the random variable representing the number of occurring events in a GSMP in a finite time horizon has finite exponential moments in a neighborhood of zero.

J	Rego, C				Rego, C			A subpath ejection method for the vehicle routing problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						tabu search; ejection chains; vehicle routing		Generically, ejection chains are methods conceived to allow solution transformations to be efficiently carried out by modifying a variable number of their components at each step of a local search algorithm. We consider a subpath ejection chain method for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) under capacity and route length restrictions. The method undertakes the identification of a substructure named the flower reference structure which, besides coordinating moves during an ejection chain construction, allows the creation of neighborhood structures with interesting combinatorial characteristics. Specifically, we base the method on a fundamental property of creating alternating paths and cycles during an ejection chain construction. A new algorithm based on a Tabu search framework is proposed, and computational results on a set of academic and real-world problems indicate that the algorithm may be a good alternative to the best heuristic algorithms for the VRP.

J	Subramaniam, V				Subramaniam, V			Efficient sourcing and debt financing in imperfect product markets	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						monopsony; sunk investment; hold-up problem; debt financing; agency costs	SUPPLIER RELATIONS; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; INDUSTRY; FIRM	Supplier relations play an important role in determining a firm's product market strategy and by affecting the cost and quality of the product produced by the firm. These relations are especially significant because the cost of purchased materials for an average firm is more than half its total sales. In this paper, we model the adverse incentives of a firm that sources from a competitive supplier industry. We show that a firm's propensity to behave opportunistically towards its suppliers raises the firm's input costs by decreasing the number of suppliers servicing it. This results in a suboptimal production decision compared to the firm's first best choice. We argue that an appropriate level of debt financing alters the shareholder incentives and mitigates the hold-up problem.

J	Banker, RD; Khosla, I; Sinha, KK				Banker, RD; Khosla, I; Sinha, KK			Quality and competition	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality; competition; cooperation; oligopoly; investment	DUOPOLY	In recent years, the practitioner literature in operations management has seen a dramatic surge in articles on quality management. It reflects the increased emphasis on quality by U.S. firms, which has been attributed largely to increased competition faced by them. The question of how quality is influenced by competitive intensity, however, has not received much attention, either in the practitioner or the academic research literatures. The notion of competitive intensity itself has not been defined precisely. In this paper, we develop formal models of oligopolistic competition to investigate whether equilibrium levels of quality increase as competition intensifies. We consider three different competitive settings: (i) asymmetric duopolistic competition where the dominant firm's intrinsic demand potential decreases; (ii) a symmetric duopoly where the firms are precluded from cooperating in setting quality levels; and (iii) symmetric oligopolistic competition where the number of firms increases. We find that the relation between equilibrium quality and competitive intensity depends on what is understood by increased competition and, in addition, the relation is contingent on the values of parameters describing the cost and demand structure for the industry.

J	Balakrishnan, R; Nagarajan, NJ; Sivaramakrishnan, K				Balakrishnan, R; Nagarajan, NJ; Sivaramakrishnan, K			The effect of property rights and audit information quality on team incentives for inventory reduction	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						teams; inventory reduction; agency models	IMPLEMENTATION	We analyze how limited contractibility and the informational quality of audits affect inventory levels and the optimality of individual versus team-based production. We use a two-period agency model in which contractibility is limited and agents meet a fixed delivery quota each period. A costly audit is triggered in any period if the delivery quota of output for the period is not met. We show that the informativeness of the audit plays a crucial role in resolving coordination problems between agents when they are organized as a team. When the audit is perfectly informative about agent productivity and inventory levels, team-based production is optimal. The team meets its quota even though, in equilibrium, the audit never takes place. If the audit is not perfectly informative about inventory levels, we show that team-based production typically induces agents to endogenously reduce inventory levels and could even result in agents adopting a zero-inventory policy. When the audit is completely uninformative, individual production is superior to team-based production.

J	Weber, EU; Hsee, C				Weber, EU; Hsee, C			Cross-cultural differences in risk perception but cross-cultural similarities in attitudes towards perceived risk	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						risk; risk perception; risk preference; risk attitude; risky choice	VALUE MODELS; UTILITY	In this study, respondents from the P.R.C., U.S.A., Germany, and Poland were found to differ in risk preference, as measured by buying prices for risky financial options. Chinese respondents were significantly less risk-averse in their pricing than Americans when risk preference was assessed in the traditional expected-utility framework. However, these apparent differences in risk preference were associated primarily with cultural differences in the perception of the risk of the financial options rather than with cultural differences in attitude towards perceived risk. In all cultures, an equal proportion (the majority) of respondents was willing to pay more for options perceived as less risky, i.e., were perceived-risk averse. These results are most naturally explained within a risk-return conceptualization of risky choice, They have practical implications for cross-cultural negotiation and commerce by suggesting the locus of cultural differences in risky choice that may allow for the creation of joint gains.

J	Duan, JC; Simonato, JG				Duan, JC; Simonato, JG			Empirical martingale simulation for asset prices	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						martingale; option pricing; Monte Carlo simulation; GARCH; Asian options	OPTIONS; VALUATION; AVERAGE; SECURITIES	This paper proposes a simple modification to the standard Monte Carlo simulation procedure for computing the prices of derivative securities. The modification imposes the martingale property on the simulated sample paths of the underlying asset price. This procedure is referred to as the empirical martingale simulation (EMS). The EMS ensures that the price estimated by simulation satisfies the rational option pricing bounds. The EMS yields a substantial error reduction for the price estimate and can be easily coupled with the standard variance reduction methods. Simulation studies are conducted for European and Asian call options using both the Black and Scholes and GARCH option pricing frameworks. The results indicate that the EMS yields substantial variance reduction particularly for in- and at-the-money or longer-maturity options. The option price estimate based on the EMS is found to exhibit a minor small-sample bias only in few occasions. An analysis of the trade-off between computing time and price accuracy reveals that the EMS dominates the conventional simulation methods.

J	Moxnes, E				Moxnes, E			Not only the tragedy of the commons: Misperceptions of bioeconomics	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						commons problem; bioeconomics; decision making; experimental economics; misperception of feedback	DYNAMIC DECISION-MAKING; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; FEEDBACK; KNOWLEDGE; MARKETS	An exploratory search for explanations of mismanagement of renewable resources, other than the theory of the commons, was performed by an experiment. Eighty three subjects, mostly recruited from the fisheries sector in Norway, were asked to manage the same simulated virgin fish stock, one subject at a time. Exclusive property rights were granted to rule out the commons problem. Despite perfect property rights, subjects consistently overinvested, leading to an average overcapacity of 60%. The resource was reduced by an average of 15% below its optimal level. Overcapacity and tough "quotas" resemble the situation in Norwegian and other fisheries during the past few decades. The likely explanation of the observed behaviour is misperception of feedback, a phenomenon that occurs in many experimental studies of dynamically complex systems. Such misperceptions add a new and important dimension to the problem of renewable resource management, beyond the commons problem.

J	Gonul, F; Shi, MZ				Gonul, F; Shi, MZ			Optimal mailing of catalogs: A new methodology using estimable structural dynamic programming models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						structural models; principle of optimality; catalogs; mailing policy	DECISIONS	We investigate the key determinants of the optimal direct mail policy in a dynamic environment where customers maximize utility and the direct mailer maximizes profits. We measure the sensitivity of the customers to receiving a catalog in the mail, while controlling for customer characteristics such as elapsed time in responses and number of purchases. We apply our model to a database from a national cataloger that markets nonseasonal products. We summarize the results of our model that are valid for these types of products. We find that the dynamic model significantly outperforms its single-period counterpart. We find that it is not optimal to mail to individuals at low recency levels because they are likely to buy anyway. It is better to save the mailing dollars for customers at higher recency levels. We find that it is optimal to mail to customers who have purchased only a small or a medium number of times to induce them to continue to buy from this catalog and not switch to others. It is not necessary to mail often to customers who have purchased many times before from the company unless they have high recency values. We find that under the optimal mailing policy the cataloguer enjoys higher profits than under the current mailing policy.

This study examines whether and how computer-mediated communication (CMC) can reduce majority influence and thereby enhance the quality of decisions in some situations. To measure the impact of CMC on majority influence, three settings (unsupported, face-to-face CMC, and dispersed CMC) were compared. Matching laboratory experiments were carried out in an individualistic (the US) and a collectivistic culture (Singapore) to determine how the impact of CMC might be moderated by national culture. An intellective and a preference task were used to see whether the impact of CMC might be moderated by task type. The results showed that the impact of CMC on majority influence was contingent upon national culture. In the individualistic culture, majority influence was stronger in the unsupported setting than the face-to-face CMC and dispersed CMC settings. In the collectivistic culture, there were no corresponding differences. The results also revealed that the impact of CMC on majority influence was not moderated by task type. Instead, task type had a direct impact on majority influence. Regardless of the setting involved, majority influence was stronger with the preference than the intellective task. Besides demonstrating how cultural factors may moderate the impact of CMC, this study raises the broader issue of cultural relativism in current knowledge on CMC.

J	Hwang, JW; Singh, MR				Hwang, JW; Singh, MR			Optimal production policies for multi-stage systems with setup costs and uncertain capacities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multi-stage systems; random yield; dynamic programming application; production decision; setup cost; capacity uncertainty	RANDOM YIELD; DEMAND	The increased complexity of modern manufacturing has led to uncertainties in production processes. Factors such as unplanned machine maintenance, tool unavailability, and complex process adjustments make it difficult to maintain a predictable level of output. To be effective, an appropriate production model must incorporate these uncertainties into the representation of the production process. This paper considers a one-time production of an application-specific product which must follow a fixed routing through the manufacturing system. The flow of items can be modeled as a multi-stage serial production line. The productive capacity is uncertain at each stage and the decision to produce at any stage incurs a significant setup cost. Semifinished products have little value and inability to satisfy the demand incurs a penalty for each unit of unmet demand. We show that the optimal production policy for this system can be characterized by two critical numbers, which can be computed apriori based on the cost parameters and distributional information for all downstream stages. Sensitivity of the critical numbers is also explored.

J	Hesterberg, TC; Nelson, BL				Hesterberg, TC; Nelson, BL			Control variates for probability and quantile estimation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; variance reduction; control variates; statistics	GENERAL SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATIONS; REGRESSION; SIMULATION; BOOTSTRAP	In stochastic systems, quantiles indicate the level of system performance that can be delivered with a specified probability, while probabilities indicate the likelihood that a specified level of system performance can be achieved. We present new estimators for use in simulation experiments designed to estimate such quantiles or probabilities of system performance. All of the estimators exploit control variates to increase their precision, which is especially important when extreme quantiles (in the tails of the distribution of system performance) or extreme probabilities (near zero or one) are of interest. Control variates are auxiliary random variables with known properties-in this case, known quantiles-and a strong stochastic association with the performance measure of interest. Since transforming a control variate can increase its effectiveness, we propose both continuous and discrete approximations to the optimal ( variance-minimizing) transformation for estimating probabilities, and then invert the probability estimators to obtain corresponding quantile estimators. We also propose a direct control-variate quantile estimator that is not based on inverting a probability estimator. An empirical study using queueing, inventory and project-planning examples shows that substantial reductions in mean squared error can be obtained when estimating the 0.9, 0.95, and 0.99 quantiles.

J	Smith, RL; Zhang, RQ				Smith, RL; Zhang, RQ			Infinite horizon production planning in time-varying systems with convex production and inventory costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						forecast horizon; dynamic lot sizing; time-varying costs	LOT SIZE MODELS; DETERMINISTIC DEMANDS; FORECAST; OPTIMIZATION; EXISTENCE	We consider the planning of production over the infinite horizon in a system with time-varying convex production and inventory holding costs. This production lot size problem is frequently faced in industry where a forecast of future demand must be made and production is to be scheduled based on the forecast. Because forecasts of the future are costly and difficult to validate, a firm would like to minimize the number of periods into the future it needs to forecast in order to make an optimal production decision today. in this paper, we first prove that under very general conditions finite horizon versions of the problem exist that lead to an optimal production level at any decision epoch. In particular, we show it suffices for the first period infinite horizon production decision to solve for a horizon that exceeds the longest time interval over which it can prove profitable to carry inventory. We then develop a closed-form expression for computing such a horizon and provide a simple finite algorithm to recursively compute an infinite horizon optimal production schedule.

J	Kulatilaka, N; Perotti, EC				Kulatilaka, N; Perotti, EC			Strategic growth options	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						strategic investment; growth options; investment under uncertainty; real options	UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; ENTRY; MODEL	We provide a strategic rationale for growth options under uncertainty and imperfect competition. In a market with strategic competition, investment confers a greater capability to take advantage of future growth opportunities. This strategic advantage leads to the capture of a greater share of the market, either by dissuading entry or by inducing competitors to "make room" for the stronger competitor. As a result of this strategic effect, payoffs are in a rough sense more convex than in the case of no investment in a growth option. When the strategic advantage is strong, increased uncertainty encourages investment in growth options: higher uncertainty means more opportunity rather than simply larger risk. If the strategic effect is weak, the reverse is true. On the other hand, an increase in systematic risk discourages the acquisition of growth options. Our results contradict the view that volatility is a strong disincentive for investment.

J	Loch, CH; Terwiesch, C				Loch, CH; Terwiesch, C			Communication and uncertainty in concurrent engineering	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; concurrent engineering; simultaneous engineering; overlapping; communication policy; frontloading; engineering changes; optimization	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MODEL	We present an analytical model of concurrent engineering, where an upstream and a downstream task are overlapped to minimize time-to-market. The gain from overlapping activities must be weighed against the delay from rework that results from proceeding in parallel based on preliminary information. Communication reduces the negative effect of rework at the expense of communication time. We derive the optimal levels of concurrency combined with communication, and we analyze how these two decisions interact in the presence of uncertainty and dependence. Uncertainty is modeled via the average rate of engineering changes, and its reduction via the change of the modification rate over time. In addition, we model dependence by the impact the modifications impose on the downstream task. The model yields three main results. First, we present a dynamic decision rule for determining the optimal meeting schedule. The optimal meeting frequency follows the frequency of engineering changes over time, and it increases with the levels of uncertainty and dependence. Second, we derive the optimal concurrency between activities when communication follows the optimal pattern described by our decision rule. Uncertainty and dependence make concurrency less attractive, reducing the optimal overlap. However, the speed of uncertainty reduction may increase or decrease optimal overlap. Third, choosing communication and concurrency separately prevents achieving the optimal time-to-market, resulting in a need for coordination.

J	O'Leary, DE				O'Leary, DE			Knowledge acquisition from multiple experts: An empirical study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						artificial intelligence; decision support systems; knowledge acquisition	PROBABILITY; JUDGMENT; SYSTEMS	Expert systems often employ a weight on rules to capture conditional probabilities. For example, in classic rule-based settings, Pr(h \ e) = x is used to mean "If e is known to be true then conclude h is true with probability x." Further, other probability-based approaches, such as influence diagrams and Bayes' Nets are increasingly being used to support decision making through decision support systems. Although algorithms for these systems have received substantial attention, less attention has been given to knowledge acquisition of probabilities used in these systems. However, the underlying probabilities are critical because they lead the user to particular solutions. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the quality of probability knowledge when it is acquired from groups or individuals. This paper summarizes the results of an empirical cognitive study on the ability of individuals and groups to provide consistent sets of probabilities Pr(A), Pr(B), Pr(A \ B) and Pr(B \ A). The analysis of these probabilities allowed the study of the ability of subjects to account for Bayes' theorem reversals, a basic assumption made by virtually all algorithms. It was found that knowledge acquisition from groups provided more correct orderings to the probabilities than knowledge acquisition from individuals. This suggests that knowledge acquisition from groups is more likely to obtain correct probability knowledge.

J	Cortazar, G; Schwartz, ES; Salinas, M				Cortazar, G; Schwartz, ES; Salinas, M			Evaluating environmental investments: A real options approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						real options; environmental economics; capital budgeting; natural resources		The paper presents a model that determines when (at which output price level) it is optimum for a firm to invest in environmental technologies and which are the main parameters that affect this decision. Our analysis shows that firms require high output price levels to be induced to invest in environmental technologies, because they optimally would not want to commit to a heavy irreversible investment that could turn out to be unprofitable in the event of a price fall. A comparative static analysis predicts that firms in industries with high output price volatility would be more reluctant to invest in environmental protection technologies and would be more willing to operate at low output levels (thus attaining low emission levels). Increases in the interest rate would also reduce optimal environmental investment levels.

J	Van Mieghem, JA				Van Mieghem, JA			Investment strategies for flexible resources	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						flexibility; technology; strategy; capacity; investment; prices; operational hedging; news-vendor model	UNCERTAINTY; CAPACITY	This article studies optimal investment in flexible manufacturing capacity as a function of product prices (margins), investment costs and multivariate demand uncertainty. We consider a two-product firm that has the option to invest in product-dedicated resources and / or in a flexible resource that can produce either product, but has to make its investment decision before demands are observed. The flexible resource provides the firm with a hedge against demand uncertainty, but at a higher investment cost than the dedicated resources. Our analysis highlights the important role of price (margin) and cost mix differentials, which, in addition to the correlation between product demands, significantly affect the investment decision and the value of flexibility. Contrary to the intuition also prevalent in the academic literature, we show that it can be advantageous to invest in flexible resources even with perfectly positively correlated product demands.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						polling models; cyclic production systems; setup times; switchover times; waiting times; variance paradox; vacation models; decomposition	JAPANESE PRODUCTION THEORY; PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; SETUP TIMES; MULTIQUEUE; SERVICE; QUEUES; LIMITS	Sarkar and Zangwill (1991) showed by numerical examples that reduction in setup times can, surprisingly, actually increase work in process in some cyclic production systems (that is, reduction in switchover times can increase waiting times in some polling models). We present, for polling models with exhaustive and gated service disciplines, some explicit formulas that provide additional insight and characterization of this anomaly. More specifically, we show that, for both of these models, there exist simple formulas that define for each queue a critical value z* of the mean total setup time z per cycle such that, if z < z*, then the expected waiting time at that queue will be minimized if the server is forced to idle for a constant length of time z* - z every cycle; also, for the symmetric polling model, we give a simple explicit formula for the expected waiting time and the critical value z* that minimizes it.

J	Kleindorfer, GB; O'Neill, L; Ganeshan, R				Kleindorfer, GB; O'Neill, L; Ganeshan, R			Validation in simulation: Various positions in the philosophy of science	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; validation; philosophy of science; hermeneutics	MODEL	There is still considerable doubt and even anxiety among simulation modelers as to what the methodologically correct guidelines or procedures for validating simulation models should be. Epistemically, the approaches one finds in the simulation literature run the gamut from objectivist to relativist with shades in between. At present in the philosophy of science, there appears to be a convergence toward a nonalgorithmic but discursive and nonrelativistic view of the argumentation involved in warranting scientific theorizing. The present gaper attempts to give a description of the various philosophical positions as well as to summarize their problems and the kinds of evidentiary arguments they would each allow in arriving at defensible simulation models. From the debate, we attempt to set out a perspective that frees the practioner to pursue a varied set of approaches to validation with a diminished burden of methodological anxiety. Reciprocally this perspective does not let the modeler off of the hook but rather converts the validation problem into an ethical problem in which the practitioner must responsibly and professionally argue for the warrant of the model.

Many redistricting plans are designed with partisan politics in mind, resulting in disputes and forcing judges to intervene. We address this problem from a nonpolitical viewpoint and present an optimization based heuristic incorporating universally agreed upon characteristics. We model the problem as a constrained graph partitioning problem and develop a specialized branch-and-price based solution methodology. We demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology by showing how to satisfy the one-person, one-vote principle with compact and contiguous districts for the state of South Carolina.

J	Meade, N; Islam, T				Meade, N; Islam, T			Technological forecasting - Model selection, model stability, and combining models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						innovation diffusion; model selection; combination of forecasts; logistic curve	INNOVATION DIFFUSION; GROWTH-CURVES; TIME-SERIES; SUBSTITUTION; PRODUCT	The paper identifies 29 models that the Literature suggests are appropriate for technological forecasting. These models are divided into three classes according to the timing of the point of inflexion in the innovation or substitution process. Faced with a given data set and such a choice, the issue of model selection needs to be addressed. Evidence used to aid model selection is drawn from measures of model fit and model stability. An analysis of the forecasting performance of these models using simulated data sets shows that it is easier to identify a class of possible models rather than the 'best' model. This leads to the combining of model forecasts. The performance of the combined forecasts appears promising with a tendency to outperform the individual component models.

In such auctions, bidders may wish to submit bids for combinations of assets. When this is allowed the problem of determining the revenue maximizing set of nonconflicting bids can be difficult. We analyze this problem, identifying several different structures of permitted combinational bids for which computational tractability is constructively demonstrated and some structures for which computational tractability cannot be guaranteed.

Evaluation tactics that relied upon subjective, judgmental, bargaining, and analytical inferences were uncovered from 317 strategic decisions. The complexity of these decisions was measured by the numbers of alternatives considered, number of criteria used, and perceived difficulty of the evaluation task to identify conditions under which the evaluation tactics were successful. The managerial implications of evaluating alternatives with the tactics that used judgmental, bargaining, analytical, and subjective inferences under different levels of complexity are discussed.

This model predicts decisions under uncertainty from (i)judgments of probability, which are assumed to satisfy support theory; and (ii) decisions under risk, which are assumed to satisfy prospect theory. In two experiments, subjects evaluated uncertain prospects and assessed the probability of the respective events. Study I involved the 1995 professional basketball playoffs; Study 2 involved the movement of economic indicators in a simulated economy. The results of both studies are consistent with the belief-based account, but violate the partition inequality implied by the classical theory of decision under uncertainty.

J	Trivedi, M				Trivedi, M			Distribution channels: An extension of exclusive retailership	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						channels of distribution; game theory; competition; pricing	PROFITS	The underlying channel structure in most studies to date has consisted either of exclusive dealers that sell only one manufacturer's brand or of a single retailer selling multiple brands. Little attention has been given to the larger segment of most consumer goods markets in which retailers compete to sell multiple brands at the same location. This research seeks to add to the growing Literature of channel competition by analyzing three channel structures, the least constrained of which deals with two competing manufacturers and two retailers, each of whom distributes both products in a noncooperative game with two Nash's and one Stackleberg equilibrium. Using differentiated products and a linear demand function, we introduce the concept of "store substitutability"-a measure corresponding to product substitutability representing competitiveness at the retail level-between the two retailers. We are able to obtain closed form solutions for all cases. We show that the presence of competitive effects at both retail and manufacturer levels of distribution has a significant impact on profits and prices. We also study the effects of various power relationships in the channel. Furthermore, we compare these results to those obtained by previous research. Finally, we propose some testable implications and suggest avenues for future research.

The learning curve (LC) provides a means to observe and track that improvement. At present, however, the concepts of CI are abstract and imprecise and the rationale underpinning the LC is obscure. For managers to improve processes effectively, they need a more scientific theory of CI and the LC. This paper begins to develop such a theory. Our approach is based on learning cycles, that is, in each period management takes an action to improve the process, observes the results, and thereby learns how to improve the process further over time. This analysis suggests a differential equation that not only characterizes continuous improvement but also reveals how learning might occur in the learning curve. This differential equation might help management to evaluate the effectiveness of various procedures and to improve and enhance industrial processes more quickly.

We show that simple generalizations of the prior research can underestimate the variance of the accumulated hedging errors and that even with daily rebalancing, these accumulated hedging errors can introduce substantial risk in arbitrage strategies suggested by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We also show that the correlation between the accumulated hedging errors for different options can be quite high, so that the risk of arbitrage due to hedging errors can be substantially reduced by optimally combining options into portfolios. The results also suggest that tests of market pricing of traded options which are based on employing a portfolio approach are likely to be much better specified than the standard tests that focus on individual options.

We find that in situations where retailers carry more than one competing brand, the promotions across brands can be positively or negatively correlated depending on the structure of the market: the relative sizes of the various market segments (In terms of loyalty to manufacturer, retailer, or the pair manufacturer-retailer). We show that sometimes retailers offer the same discount on different products, but at other times they offer a smaller discount on a brand supported by a bigger trade deal. We also present results on the effects of changes in the sizes of the different market segments on the depth of price promotions and trade deals and on pass through.

We characterize the optimal policy for the case of homogeneous products. Because of the difficulty in computing the optimal base-stock levels for the heterogeneous case, we propose a heuristic that is simple enough for practical applications. We present numerical results that suggest that the heuristic yields near-optimal solutions.

J	Joro, T; Korhonen, P; Wallenius, J				Joro, T; Korhonen, P; Wallenius, J			Structural comparison of data envelopment analysis and multiple objective linear programming	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						data envelopment analysis; multiple objective linear programming; efficiency; performance measurement	DECISION-MAKING UNITS; INFINITESIMALS; EFFICIENCY	The concept of efficiency as it applies to Decision Making Units (DMUs), solutions, alternatives plays an important role both in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP). Despite this and other apparent similarities, DEA and MOLP research has developed separately. We show that structurally the DEA formulation to identify efficient units is quite similar to the MOLP model based on the reference point or the reference direction approach to generate efficient solutions. DEA and MOLP should not be seen as substitutes, but rather as complements. We show that they cross-fertilize each other. MOLP provides interesting extensions to DEA and DEA provides new areas of application to MOLP.

J	Mandelbaum, A; Reiman, MI				Mandelbaum, A; Reiman, MI			On pooling in queueing networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						service facility design; flexible server; specialized server; service operations, efficiency, stability, economics of scale	QUEUING-NETWORKS; FEEDBACK; ALLOCATION; SYSTEMS	We view each station in a Jackson network as a queue of tasks, of a particular type, which are to be processed by the associated specialized server. A complete pooling of queues, into a single queue, and servers, into a single server, gives rise to an M/PH/1 queue, where the server is flexible in the sense that it processes all tasks. We assess the value of complete pooling by comparing the steady-state mean sojourn times of these two systems. The main insight from our analysis is that care must be used in pooling. Sometimes pooling helps, sometimes it hurts, and its effect (good or bad) can be unbounded. Also discussed briefly are alternative pooling scenarios, for example complete pooling of only queues which results in an M/PH/S system, or partial pooling which can be devastating enough to turn a stable Jackson network into an unstable Bramson network. We conclude with some possible future research directions.

J	Basu, A; Blanning, RW				Basu, A; Blanning, RW			The analysis of assumptions in model bases using metagraphs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						assumptions; model management; graph theory; decision support systems; information systems	SYSTEMS	Decision models are often based on certain assumptions as to their validity. Relevant assumptions may include value-based assumptions, such as limitations on the range or values of some input variables or exogenous factors, as well as assumptions about model structure (e.g., Linearity). In a model base consisting of many models, there may be several models (or collections of models) that can be used to solve a particular problem. We may wish to know what the applicable models are, what assumptions are associated with these models, and whether a given set of assumptions is necessary and/or sufficient for solving the problem. We describe an analytical approach, based on a graph-theoretic construct called a metagraph, and show how it can be used to represent and analyze assumptions in model bases.

We find organizational experience has a U-shaped effect on failure; that organizations enjoy reduced failure as a function of population experience before their founding, but not after; and that related organizations provide experience that lowers failure, but it matters whether their experience is local or non-local, and if it was acquired before or after the relationship was established. These results indicate both the difficulty of applying different types of experience to reduce the risk of organizational failure, and the relevance of experience for the evolution of organizational populations.

J	Gupta, D; Srinivasan, MM				Gupta, D; Srinivasan, MM			Note: How does product proliferation affect responsiveness?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product variety; make-to-order production systems; queueing; polling models		In this note we consider some strategies that a manufacturing firm may use to deal with an increase in the variety of products it offers. We indicate how alternate strategies for dealing with product proliferation impact the firm's responsiveness, measured in terms of average production lead time and average work-in-process inventory. Focusing on the make-to-order environment and using queueing models, we derive conditions under which an increase in product variety can improve both individual product performance as well as system performance, thus contradicting a common belief that a greater degree of focus and greater responsiveness go hand in hand.

J	Thomke, SH				Thomke, SH			Managing experimentation in the design of new products	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						experimentation economics; product design and development; computer simulation; prototyping; mode switching; iterative learning	INFORMATION	Experimentation, a form of problem-solving, is a fundamental innovation activity and accounts for a significant part of total innovation cost and time. In many fields, the economics of experimentation are being radically affected by the use of new and greatly improved versions of methods such as computer simulation, mass screening, and rapid prototyping. This paper shows that a given experiment (and the related trial and error learning) can be conducted in different "modes" (e.g., computer simulation and rapid prototyping) and that users Will find it economical to optimize the switching between these modes as to reduce total product development cost and time. The findings are confirmed by a large-scale empirical study of the experimentation process in the design of integrated circuits containing either (1) electrically programmable logic devices (EPLDs); or (2) application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In comparing their different experimentation strategies for analogous design projects, I found that the former (EPLD)-an approach that utilizes many prototype iterations-outperformed the latter (ASIC) by factor of 2.2 (in person-months) and over 43 percent of that difference can be attributed to differences in experimentation strategies. The implications for managerial practice and theory are discussed and suggestions for further research undertakings are provided.

J	Bayus, BL				Bayus, BL			An analysis of product lifetimes in a technologically dynamic industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product life-cycles; personal computer industry; failure time analysis	TIME	The conventional wisdom that product lifetimes are shrinking has important implications for technology management and product planning. However, very limited empirical information on this topic is available. Ln this paper, product lifetimes are directly measured as the time between product introduction and withdrawal. Statistical analyses of desktop personal computer models introduced between 1974 and 1992 are conducted at various product market levels. Results indicate that (1) product technology and product model lifetimes have not accelerated, and (2) manufacturers have not systematically reduced the life-cycles of products within their lines. Instead, the products of firms that have entered this industry in the more recent years tend to be based on previously existing technology, and, not surprisingly, these products have lifetimes that are shorter than those of established firms. Implications of these findings are discussed.

J	Balachander, S; Srinivasan, K				Balachander, S; Srinivasan, K			Modifying customer expectations of price decreases for a durable product	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						customer expectations; high-technology marketing; learning curve; pricing; signalling	LEARNING-CURVE; EQUILIBRIA; QUALITY; SIGNAL; MODEL	We study the introductory signalling strategy for a durable product that faces optimistic expectations among customers about price declines over time. The firm introducing the product knows that experiential learning is low for the product. However, customers, being uncertain about the extent of experiential learning, assign a nonzero probability that the firm's new product will enjoy a high cost reduction with cumulative experience. The optimistic expectations of customers reduce their willingness to pay a high price at the product's introduction while predisposing them to buying later. The challenge facing the low-experience firm is to choose an introductory strategy that will credibly convey the low experience-curve effect to customers. We use the sequential equilibrium concept in a game-theoretic framework to identify the firm's signalling strategy. We identify the unique separating equilibrium of the game after refining the set of separating equilibria. We demonstrate that a high introductory price credibly signals the low experiential learning to customers. We also show that signalling causes an artificial learning-curve effect.

J	Verheyen, P				Verheyen, P			The missing link in budget models of nonprofit institutions: Two practical Dutch applications	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						nonprofit organizations; budget; professional tasks; health services; education	INCENTIVES; FRAMEWORK; ORGANIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; HOSPITALS; SYSTEMS; CARE	The Dutch government, health insurance associations, and research boards allocate budgets to nonprofit institutions (hospitals, universities), based on general indicators (inhabitants, admissions, or students). With these budgets, the top management of each institution (the principal) allocates the funds, using general indicators to distribute the money further down to the base. At the base of the nonprofit institutions, the professionals (the agents) perform a spectrum of specific tasks. Tension around the budgetting process exists between top management and professionals. This paper resolves the tension along the research lines of Burton and Obel (1995) by measuring in money terms the specific tasks of the professionals of universities and hospitals at the base, and by reconsidering the theoretical background of the internal budget system. The study also develops the missing link in an integral external and internal budget system by integrating the managerial and professional decisions or the input-output decisions in one approach.

J	Gaba, A; Viscusi, WK				Gaba, A; Viscusi, WK			Differences in subjective risk thresholds: Worker groups as an example	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						risk perceptions; risk thresholds; risk premiums; dichotomous Variables	TASTE TESTS; MODEL	Subjective risk perceptions are often encoded as responses to 0-1 questions in surveys or other qualitative risk scales. However, reference points for assessing an activity as risky are confounded by various characteristics of the respondents. This paper uses a sample of workers for whom quantitative risk assessments as well as dichotomous risk perception responses are available. It is shown that, given a quantitative risk measure, the thresholds for assessing an activity as "risky" vary systematically, particularly by education. The differences in such thresholds across worker groups are estimated. The resulting implications of using qualitative risk variables for assessing wage-risk tradeoffs are estimated, yielding results that are also relevant for many other areas involving similar qualitative variables.

J	Kleijnen, JPC; Bettonvil, B; Van Groenendaal, W				Kleijnen, JPC; Bettonvil, B; Van Groenendaal, W			Validation of trace-driven simulation models: A novel regression test	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						correlation; paired observations; goodness-of-fit; type II error; power; simultaneous tests	VERIFICATION	This paper argues that it is wrong to require that regressing the outputs of a trace-driven simulation on the observed real outcomes should give a 45 degrees (unit slope) line through the origin (zero intercept). This note proposes instead an alternative requirement: the responses of the simulated and the real systems should have the same means and the same variances. To test statistically whether this requirement is satisfied, a novel procedure is derived: regress the differences between simulated and real responses on their associated sums, and test whether the resulting intercept and slope are both zero. This novel but simple test assumes identically, independently, and normally distributed outputs of the real system and the simulated system. The old and the new procedures are investigated in extensive Monte Carlo experiments that simulate M/M/1 queueing systems. The conclusions are: (i) the naive intuitive test rejects a valid simulation model substantially more often than the novel test does; (ii) the naive test shows "perverse" behavior within a certain domain: the worse the simulation model, the higher its estimated probability of acceptance; and (iii) the novel test does not reject a valid simulation model too often (its type I error probability is correct), provided the queueing response is transformed appropriately to obtain (nearly) normally distributed responses.

J	Miller, JH				Miller, JH			Active nonlinear tests (ANTs) of complex simulation models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						testing simulation models; nonlinear sensitivity analysis; validation; World3 model; genetic algorithms		Simulation models are becoming increasingly common in the analysis of critical scientific, policy, and management issues. Such models provide a way to analyze complex systems characterized by both large parameter spaces and nonlinear interactions. Unfortunately, these same characteristics make understanding such models using traditional testing techniques extremely difficult. Here we show how a model's structure and robustness can be validated via a simple, automatic, nonlinear search algorithm designed to actively "break" the model's implications. Using the active nonlinear tests (ANTs) developed here, one can easily probe for key weaknesses in a simulation's structure, and thereby begin to improve and refine its design. We demonstrate ANTs by testing a well-known model of global dynamics (World3), and show how this technique can be used to uncover small, but powerful, nonlinear effects that may highlight vulnerabilities in the original model.

J	Shaw, DX; Wagelmans, APM				Shaw, DX; Wagelmans, APM			An algorithm for single-item capacitated economic lot sizing with piecewise linear production costs and general holding costs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						economic lot sizing; dynamic programming; computational complexity	COMPLEXITY	We consider the Capacitated Economic Lot Size Problem with piecewise linear production costs and general holding costs, which is an NP-hard problem but solvable in pseudopolynomial time. A straightforward dynamic programming approach to this problem results in an O(n(2)(c) over bar (d) over bar) algorithm, where n is the number of periods, and (d) over bar and care the average demand and the average production capacity over the n periods, respectively. However, we present a dynamic programming procedure with complexity O(n(2)(q) over bar (d) over bar), where (q) over bar is the average number of pieces required to represent the production cost functions. In particular, this means that problems in which the production functions consist of a fixed set-up cost plus a linear variable cost are solved in O(n(2)(d) over bar) time. Hence, the running time of our algorithm is only linearly dependent on the magnitude of the data. This result also holds if extensions such as backlogging and startup costs are considered. Moreover, computational experiments indicate that the algorithm is capable of solving quite large problem instances within a reasonable amount of time. For example, the average time needed to solve test instances with 96 periods, 8 pieces in every production cost function, and average demand of 100 units is approximately 40 seconds on a SUN SPARC 5 workstation.

The zero-condition simplifies the measurement and derivation of the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) measure commonly used in medical decision analysis. For general multiattribute utility theory, no simple condition has heretofore been found to characterize multiplicatively decomposable forms. When the zero-condition is satisfied, however, such a simple condition, "standard gamble invariance," becomes available.

We evaluate the performance of this heuristic by comparing its solutions to optimal solutions of small randomly generated problems and to time-truncated Optimization Subroutine Library (OSL) solutions of medium-sized randomly generated problems. In the first case, the heuristic locates solutions averaging 4 percent worse than optimal in less than 1 percent of time required by OSL. The heuristic solutions to medium-sized problems are approximately 26 percent better than solutions OSL finds after 10,000 CPU seconds, and the heuristic finds these solutions in approximately 10 percent of OSL time.

J	Dewan, S; Mendelson, H				Dewan, S; Mendelson, H			Information technology and time-based competition in financial markets	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						time-based competition; trading; financial markets; information technology investment; information technology infrastructure	DISCONTINUOUS ECONOMIC GAMES; STOCK-PRICES; EQUILIBRIUM; VOLATILITY; EXISTENCE; NEWS	This paper studies time-based competition in imperfect securities markets, linking IT investment decisions, information processing delays, and trading strategies. At the IT investment stage, traders trade off the cost of IT against their anticipated trading profits. At the trading stage, each trader devises a trading strategy based on his new information while taking into account the impact of both his own trades and those of other traders in the market. Our results illustrate how traders react to market imperfections due to trading costs and information processing delays, and how superior traders convert a timeliness advantage into higher trading profits. They also shed light on the relationship between the price adjustment process and traders' information processing delays. Timeliness imposes an interesting structure on trader competition: traders with longer information processing delays trade less frequently, submit smaller orders and enjoy lower profits per trade. Our analysis of traders' IT investment decisions demonstrates how factors such as IT costs, number of traders, and the frequency and nature of new information affect the level of IT investments. We further illustrate how improved IT infrastructure translates into competitive advantage.

J	Morwitz, VG; Schmittlein, DC				Morwitz, VG; Schmittlein, DC			Testing new direct marketing offerings: The interplay of management judgment and statistical models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; models; managers; segmentation	EXPECTATIONS; PROBABILITY; SYSTEMS	The launch of a new product or service via direct marketing is nearly always preceded by a test of that offering. Such a "live" test, conducted with a subset of the entire list of customer prospects, can sometimes be useful in a "go/no-go" decision regarding a full-scale launch of the offering. More commonly, the test is used to direct the offering more effectively toward the market segments that appear most promising. Specifically, test results are used and useful to determine whether a particular rental list of customer prospects should indeed be rented, and (for both rental and in-house lists) which specific customer segments should be contacted with the offering. This paper examines the effectiveness of managers' decisions related to designing a test and interpreting test results both conceptually-based on the literature of heuristics and biases in expert judgments-and empirically, for two new direct marketing offers. The paper describes how an interplay of management judgment and statistical models can lead to increased profits for new direct marketing offerings.

J	von Hippel, E				von Hippel, E			Economics of product development by users: The impact of "sticky" local information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						user innovation; sticky information; local information; heterogeneous markets; mass customization; specialization in problem solving; task partitioning	INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE	Those who solve more of a given type of problem tend to get better at it-which suggests that problems of any given type should be brought to specialists for a solution. However, in this paper we argue that agency-related costs and information transfer costs ("sticky" local information) will tend drive the locus of problem-solving in the opposite direction-away from problem-solving by specialist suppliers, and towards those who directly benefit from a solution and who have difficult-to-transfer local information about a particular application being solved, such as the direct users of a product or service. We examine the actual location of design activities in two fields in which custom products are produced by "mass-customization'' methods: application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and computer telephony integration (CTI) systems. In both, we find that users rather than suppliers are the actual designers of the application-specific portion of the product types examined. We offer anecdotal evidence that the pattern of user-based customization we have documented in these two fields is in fact quite general, and we discuss implications for research and practice.

J	van Bruggen, GH; Smidts, A; Wierenga, B				van Bruggen, GH; Smidts, A; Wierenga, B			Improving decision making by means of a marketing decision support system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; decision support systems; managerial decision making	COGNITIVE-STYLE; INFORMATION PRESENTATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT; DESIGN; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; AIDS; EXPECTATIONS; UNCERTAINTY	Marketing decision makers are confronted with an increasing amount of information. This leads to a complex decision environment that may cause decision makers to lapse into using mental-effort-reducing heuristics such as anchoring and adjustment, in an experimental study, we find that the use of a marketing decision support system (MDSS) increases the effectiveness of marketing decision makers. An MDSS is effective because it assists its users in identifying the important decision variables and, subsequently, making better decisions based on those variables. Decision makers using an MDSS are also less susceptible to applying the anchoring and adjustment heuristic and, therefore show more variation in their decisions in a dynamic environment. Low-analytical decision makers and decision makers operating under low time pressure especially benefit from using an MDSS.

J	Leland, JW				Leland, JW			Similarity judgments in choice under uncertainty: A reinterpretation of the predictions of regret theory	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision making; similarity judgments; regret theory; choice theory	DECISION-MAKING; UTILITY; DISAPPOINTMENT; RISK	The Regret theory of Loomes and Sugden (1982) predicts choice anomalies implied by other alternatives to expected utility (e.g., violations of the independence axiom). It also makes unique and controversial predictions regarding the rational violation of stochastic dominance and invariance. All these predictions depend critically on assumptions regarding the statistical independence or dependence of the available alternatives. None of the predictions depend on the framing or representation of the alternatives. Leland (1994) shows that a model of choice based on similarity judgments predicts choices implied by Regret theory. In contrast to Regret theory, however, these predictions depend critically on the way the choices are framed and not on the dependence or independence of the alternatives. This paper presents experimental results indicating that the frequencies with which violations of independence, dominance, and invariance occur are, in most cases, insensitive to the statistical dependence or independence of the alternatives but sensitive to the way the choices are presented. These findings support the hypothesis that such behaviors arise as a consequence of reliance upon similarity judgments.

J	Young, MR				Young, MR			A minimax portfolio selection rule with linear programming solution	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						mean-variance analysis; optimization; utility theory; volatility		A new principle for choosing portfolios based on historical returns data is introduced; the optimal portfolio based on this principle is the solution to a simple linear programming problem. This principle uses minimum return rather than variance as a measure of risk. In particular, the portfolio is chosen that minimizes the maximum loss over all past observation periods, for a given level of return. This objective function avoids the logical problems of a quadratic (nonmonotone) utility function implied by mean-variance portfolio selection rules. The resulting minimax portfolios are diversified; for normal returns data, the portfolios are nearly equivalent to those chosen by a mean-variance rule. Framing the portfolio selection process as a linear optimization problem also makes it feasible to constrain certain decision variables to be integer, or 0-1, valued; this feature facilitates the use of more complex decision-making models, including models with fixed transaction charges and models with Boolean-type constraints on allocations.

J	Berg, M; Schouten, FV; Jansen, J				Berg, M; Schouten, FV; Jansen, J			Optimal batch provisioning to customers subject to a delay-limit	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							QUEUES	This work deals with batch provisioning and order aggregation. Two examples are: (i) a manufacturer that has to deliver items to customers in a remote destination, and (ii) a company that provides repair and replacement service to its clients. In both cases the remoteness of customers suggests order aggregation-a batch delivery in the first example, and a batch-visits journey in the other; the alternative is to provide individual services to customers. A key element is a contractual obligation of the company to provide service within an agreed delay-limit, and in that view the main decision problem is to determine the moments at which a batch service should be executed. That decision would depend on: (random) demand-arrival patterns, the costs associated with the two service modes (batch and individual), as well as the model used to describe operating conditions. This paper proposes and investigates several service-provision policies, with a simple enough structure to make them appealing for real-life implementation. Optimal service-provision procedures are obtained for these policies, minimizing the long-run expected cost per unit of time. The optimal costs of the proposed policies are compared and their relative performance is evaluated with respect to the global minimal cost (of the optimal policy) on one hand, and basic policies that employ either only batch or only individual services on the other hand. Finally, a range of model generalizations of interest is presented and the relationship of the problem here to broader issues is discussed.

The relationship between the lotsizing problem and the batch sequencing problem is analyzed. The batch sequencing problem is solved with a branch & bound algorithm which is accelerated by bounding and dominance rules. The algorithm is compared with recently published procedures for solving variants of the DLSP and is found to be more efficient if the number of items is not large.

We present a new 0-1 linear programming formulation of the problem that requires an exponential number of variables, corresponding to all feasible subsets of activities that can be simultaneously executed without violating resource or precedence constraints. Different relaxations of the above formulation are used to derive new lower bounds, which dominate the value of the longest path on the precedence graph and are tighter than the bound proposed by Stinson et al.

Computational results indicate that the exact algorithm can solve hard instances that cannot be solved by the best algorithms reported in the literature.

J	Gersbach, H				Gersbach, H			On the equivalence of general and specific control in organizations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multitask principal-agent problems; design of control in organizations; incentive schemes; risk diversification and incentives	PRODUCT; PLAN	Most principal-agent relationships in firms are multidimensional. In the presence of multiple tasks and multiple performance signals, the contract between principal and agent not only has to motivate the agent, but also has to direct the agent to allocate effort among different tasks. The value of efforts for a specific task accrues not only through the principal's expected returns, but also through its contribution to overall risk, and therefore to the risk diversification of the task portfolio. Hence, if the agent is risk-averse, multitask relationships can be considered as a portfolio problem coupled with incentive constraints. We examine the relationship between specific control (SC) and general control (GC) for multitask principal-agent problems. Under SC, the principal observes the outcome of each individual task and uses this set of information for compensation. Under GC, contracts are based only on the aggregate signal, such as cumulative profits of all tasks. We describe two sets of multitask problems for which GC and SC are equivalent. That is, contracts based only on aggregate performance signals impose the same incentives for the agent as a contract that is based on the outcome of each task. The first multitask problem is characterized by homogeneous tasks. In the second multitask problem, all activities are perfect substitutes in the cost function of the agent. The equivalence of SC and GC arises since GC provides insurance to the agent and yields the same overall risk premium as specific control. Moreover, GC allows the principal to set the same incentives as SC, since the marginal returns from GC are equal to the sum of the marginal returns for each task under SC. The results described in this paper can serve as benchmarks where GC and SC are equivalent. We show how the equivalence can be relevant for a variety of business situations, such as the compensation of sales persons or managers at all hierarchy levels. We also discuss the reasons when GC and SC differ. Suppose, for instance, that tasks are technologically separable and the precision of the performance of one task is low. Then, the principal is forced under GC to adopt an incentive scheme that implements only a low effort across all tasks since the average precision matters. Under SC, however, the principal can tailor the optimal efforts to each task.

J	Banker, RD; Davis, GB; Slaughter, SA				Banker, RD; Davis, GB; Slaughter, SA			Software development practices, software complexity, and software maintenance performance: A field study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software maintenance; software complexity; software productivity; software quality; software economics; software metrics; management of computing and information systems	TASK COMPLEXITY; PRODUCTIVITY; SCIENCE; METRICS	Software maintenance claims a large proportion of organizational resources. It is thought that many maintenance problems derive from inadequate software design and development practices. Poor design choices can result in complex software that is costly to support and difficult to change. However, it is difficult to assess the actual maintenance performance effects of software development practices because their impact is realized over the software life cycle. To estimate the impact of development activities in a more practical time frame, this research develops a two-stage model in which software complexity is a key intermediate variable that links design and development decisions to their downstream effects on software maintenance. The research analyzes data collected from a national mass merchandising retailer on 29 software enhancement projects and 23 software applications in a large IBM COBOL environment. Results indicate that the use of a code generator in development is associated with increased software complexity and software enhancement project effort. The use of packaged software is associated with decreased software complexity and software enhancement effort. These results suggest an important link between software development practices and maintenance performance.

J	Alles, M; Datar, S				Alles, M; Datar, S			Strategic transfer pricing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						transfer pricing; full cost allocation; incentives; costing	INCENTIVES	Most research into cost systems has focused on their motivational implications. This paper takes a different approach, by developing a model where two oligopolistic firms strategically select their cost-based transfer prices. Duopoly models frequently assume that firms game on their choice of prices. Product prices, however, are ultimately based on the firms' transfer prices that communicate manufacturing costs to marketing departments. It is for this reason that transfer prices will have a strategic component to them. We derive implications for cost system choice and transfer pricing, including showing that firms may cross subsidize their products-a result consistent with the empirical evidence.

From this perspective, information outputs can be viewed as information products, and many information systems can be modeled as information manufacturing systems. The use of information products is becoming increasingly prevalent both within and across organizational boundaries. This paper presents a set of ideas, concepts, models, and procedures appropriate to information manufacturing systems that can be used to determine the quality of Information products delivered, or transferred, to information customers. These systems produce information products on a regular or as-requested basis. The model systematically tracks relevant attributes of the information product such as timeliness, accuracy and cost. This is facilitated through an information manufacturing analysis matrix that relates data units and various system components. Measures of these attributes can then be used to analyze potential improvements to the information manufacturing system under consideration. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the various features of the information manufacturing system and show how it can be used to analyze and improve the system.

J	Ferson, WE; Locke, DH				Ferson, WE; Locke, DH			Estimating the cost of capital through time: An analysis of the sources of error	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						cost of capital; capital budgeting; risk premium; beta; capital asset pricing model; forecasting; business valuation	GENERALIZED-METHOD; SAMPLE PROPERTIES; PRICING THEORY; ARBITRAGE; RETURNS; MOMENTS; TESTS	Practitioners needing estimates of a firm's equity cost of capital have long relied on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Recent evidence casts renewed doubt on the validity of the CAPM and beta. However, there is not much evidence to gauge the importance of the rejections of the CAPM in a practical decision-making context. This paper presents evidence on the sources of error in estimating required returns over time. We use a number of proxies for the true mean variance efficient portfolio, allowing that the CAPM is the "wrong" model. The analyst is assumed to rely on a standard market index. We find that the great majority of the error in estimating the cost of equity capital is found in the risk premium estimate, and relatively small errors are due to the risk measure, or beta. This suggests that analysts should improve estimation procedures for market risk premiums, which are commonly based on historical averages. This can be done by using regression models, such as:have appeared in the recent finance literature, or by purchasing forecasts from firms that specialize in producing them.

J	van Witteloostuijn, A				van Witteloostuijn, A			Bridging behavioral and economic theories of decline: Organizational inertia, strategic competition, and chronic failure	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational decline; game theoretical modeling and nonprofit maximizing behavior	BUSINESS-CYCLE; TIME-SERIES; FIRM ENTRY; LIFE-CYCLE; EXIT; INDUSTRIES; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; DECISIONS; BANKRUPTCY	This paper is another plea for bridging behavioral and economic approaches to the study of competition in markets and strategy making by firms. The arguments focus on a specific case in point: the behavioral theory of organizational decline and the economic modeling of immediate exit. The arguments come in three steps. First, the literature on organizational decline is reviewed by organizing a framework that summarizes arguments from varying economic and organizational perspectives that have, for the most part, developed independently. Observations from empirical and theoretical studies are combined in order to investigate the causes, conditions, courses, and consequences of organizational downturn. Second, a theoretical argument is developed that explains voluntary exit and chronic failure by introducing a proxy of organizational inertia in a model of strategic Cournot duopoly. The key assumptions, which have a behavioral flavour that seemingly contradicts orthodox economics, are grounded in the theoretical and empirical literatures. The results of the model support the claim that "pure profit maximizing behavior may be at the expense of organizational survival" (D'Aveni 1990, p. 135). Third, by formulating two hypotheses and presenting tentative evidence from the chemical industry, the paper hopes to convincingly argue that such integrative models lead to empirical testing of interesting hypotheses. A key finding here is that inefficient firms may outlast their efficient rivals (cf. D'Aveni 1989a).

J	Regenwetter, M; Grofman, B				Regenwetter, M; Grofman, B			Approval voting, borda winners, and condorcet winners: Evidence from seven elections	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						approval voting; Borda winner; condorcet winner; random utility theory; social choice; social welfare order	PLURALITY	We analyze 10 three-candidate elections (and mock elections) conducted under approval voting (AV) using a method developed by Falmagne and Regenwetter (1996) that allows us to construct a distribution of rank orders from subset choice data. The elections were held by the Institute of Management Science, the Mathematical Association of America, several professional organizations in Britain, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Seven of the 10 elections satisfy the conditions under which the Falmagne-Regenwetter method is suitable. For these elections we recreate possible underlying preferences of the electorate. On the basis of these distributions of preferences we find strong evidence that AV would have selected Condorcet winners when they exist and would have always selected the Borda winner, Thus, we find that AV is not just simple to use, but also gives rise to outcomes that well reflect voter preferences. Our results also have an important implication fur the general study of social choice processes, They suggest that transitive majority orderings may be expected in real-world settings more often then the formal social choice literature suggests. In six out of seven data sets we find social welfare orders; only one data set generates cycles anywhere in the solution space.

J	Brusco, MJ; Jacobs, LW				Brusco, MJ; Jacobs, LW			Personnel tour scheduling when starting-time restrictions are present	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						workforce scheduling; linear programming; heuristics	DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM; DAY-OFF; SHIFT; WORKFORCE; REQUIREMENTS; CONSTRAINTS; ENVIRONMENT; FORMULATIONS; DEMANDS; BREAK	This payer presents an effective solution strategy for an important category of personnel scheduling problems. Specifically, we address the restricted starting-time tour-scheduling problem (RSTP), which involves the determination of the hours of the day (shifts) and days of the week (days on) that employees are assigned to work. RSTP is characterized by restrictions on the number of daily time periods in which employees may begin their shifts. Moreover, the RSTP we consider contains constraints that require separation of starting times. Such restrictions are widely encountered in practice and are based on a number of factors including managerial concerns for control of employee movements, union contractual obligations, and employee preferences for common shift starting times. A two-stage heuristic solution strategy is proposed for RSTP. We developed eight heuristic procedures based on this strategy and applied them to four sets of labor requirements, for each of 27 United Airlines (UA) airport ground stations. One of the best of these procedures yielded solution costs that averaged only 1.36 full-time-equivalent employees above very conservative LP-based lower bounds. Moreover, the solution costs obtained using this procedure were, on average, 28 percent closer to the lower bounds than solution costs obtained using UA's current scheduling system. We conclude that the two-stage heuristic solution strategy is a valuable platform from which to develop procedures for generating near-optimal solutions to this difficult class of personnel scheduling problems.

J	Lewis, GH; Srinivasan, A; Subrahmanian, E				Lewis, GH; Srinivasan, A; Subrahmanian, E			Staffing and allocation of workers in an administrative office	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						services; staffing; worker allocation; organization design and performance	ROBUSTNESS; MOBILITY; QUEUES; MODEL	The world of work is increasingly characterized by processing of records, forms, or cases. This processing is usually organized as a set of interdependent tasks within an administrative office. A major issue facing such administrative offices is how they should be organized to maximize productivity when short-term reassignment of workers is difficult; costly, or severely restricted. The present work grew out of a study conducted at a Count-Jr Assistance Office in Western Pennsylvania and addresses three important productivity questions in organizational productivity: (1) How should a given number of workers be allocated across related tasks, (2) will the arrangement that seems best for productivity increase or decrease equity within the office, and (3) what is the optimal size of an office? To answer question 1, we model the administrative office as a closed queueing network. Thus modeled, the problem has an optimal allocation of workers, and we propose an efficient method for finding it. in response to question 2, we show (1) that for offices of a fixed size, the allocation of workers that maximizes throughput also maximizes equity, and (2) that across offices of different sizes, throughput per worker is not monotonicly related to equity. Changes in the size of the office that improve productivity may have lower equity; conversely, changes in the size of the office that improve equity may have lower productivity. Finally, in response to question 3, we show that the previous results can be used to determine the optimal office size in terms of throughput, This result has relevance for situations in which there are multiple offices of the same type. To the extent that worker satisfaction is related to equity, these results imply that managers may have to choose between worker satisfaction and output in setting the size of the office, but for offices of a fixed size, the allocation that maximizes output will also maximize worker satisfaction.

J	Shaver, JM				Shaver, JM			Accounting for endogeneity when assessing strategy performance: Does entry mode choice affect FDI survival?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						endogenous strategy choice; foreign direct investment; survival; entry mode	MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES; UNITED-STATES; FIRMS	Firms choose strategies based on their attributes and industry conditions; therefore, strategy choice is endogenous and self-selected. Empirical models that do not account for this and regress performance measures on strategy choice variables are potentially misspecified and their conclusions incorrect. I highlight how self-selection on hard-to-measure or unobservable characteristics can bias strategy performance estimates and recommend an econometric technique that has been developed to account for this effect. Although this concern applies to a wide range of strategy questions, to demonstrate its effect I empirically examine if entry mode choice (acquisition versus greenfield) influences foreign direct investment survival. In specifications that do not account for self-selection, I find that greenfield entries have survival advantages compared to acquisitions. This confirms previous findings. However, the significance of this effect disappears once I account for self-selection of entry mode in the empirical estimates. The results confirm that estimates from models that do not account for self-selection of strategy choice can lead to incorrect or misleading conclusions.

This paper introduces a new approach to capturing and using value judgments in DEA, based on unobserved Decision Making Units. In so doing, it opens up a whole new approach for reflecting value judgments in DEA assessments, which can offer advantages in certain situations.

J	Smith, SA; Achabal, DD				Smith, SA; Achabal, DD			Clearance pricing and inventory policies for retail chains	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; pricing; retailing	PRODUCTION DECISIONS; SALES; DEMAND; UNCERTAINTY; MONOPOLIST	Clearance pricing and end of season inventory management are challenging and important problems in retailing. Sales rates depend upon price, seasonal effects, and the remaining assortment of items available to customers. There is little time to react to observed sales, and pricing errors result in either loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be liquidated. This paper develops optimal clearance prices and inventory management policies that take into account the impact of reduced assortment and seasonal changes on sales rates. Versions of these policies have been tested and implemented at three major retail chains and these applications are summarized and discussed.

J	Degraeve, Z; Vandebroek, M				Degraeve, Z; Vandebroek, M			A mixed integer programming model for solving a layout problem in the fashion industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						layout problem; cutting stock problem; fashion industry; mixed integer programming		The cutting operation in the high fashion clothing industry essentially involves putting several layers of cloth on a long cutting table and fixing templates of the parts of several articles on top of the stack before the actual cutting can be initiated. This is a very time-consuming task giving raise to high setup costs in addition to waste production resulting from the cutting process. Total production costs can then be optimized by minimizing the number of these setups while at the same time producing little or no waste. In this paper a mixed integer programming model is proposed that searches for an optimal set of cutting patterns, each giving a combination of articles to be cut in one operation, and corresponding stack heights.

While the standard admission policy consists of rejecting only those customers who arrive when all servers are busy, we address the problem of finding the optimal static admission policy (with respect to a given reward structure) when customers can be discriminated according to the group they belong to, thus customers of some groups might be automatically rejected (even if some servers remain idle) in order to enhance the global efficiency of the system. The optimality of a c mu-rule is shown, from which finite-time algorithms for the one-and two-server cases are derived.

J	Shumsky, RA				Shumsky, RA			Optimal updating of forecasts for the timing of future events	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						forecasting; dynamic programming applications; air transportation		A major problem in forecasting is estimating the time of some future event. Traditionally, forecasts are designed to minimize an error cost function that is evaluated once, possibly when the event occurs and forecast accuracy can be determined. However, in many applications forecast error costs accumulate over time, and the forecasts themselves may be updated with information that is collected as the expected time of the event approaches. This paper examines one such application in which flow control managers in the U.S. air traffic system depend on forecasts of aircraft departure times to predict and alleviate potential congestion. These forecasts are periodically updated until take-off occurs, although the number of updates may be limited by the cost of collecting, processing, and distributing information. The procedures developed in this paper balance the costs of accumulated forecast errors and the costs of forecast updates. The procedures are applied to the aircraft departure forecasting problem and are compared with methods currently used by the air traffic management system. Numerical examples demonstrate that the procedures increase forecast accuracy while reducing the costs associated with frequent forecast updates.

Computational experience is reported, showing that the approach optimally solves the most difficult problems reported in the literature. For challenging problems of limited size, which are capable of being approached by exact procedures, we find optimal solutions considerably faster than the best reported exact method. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more efficient and yields better solutions than the best heuristic method reported to date. Finally, we give outcomes for larger problems that are considerably more challenging than any currently reported in the literature.

The approach is based on the beta-distribution assumption; also, mast PERT-type formulas use only three estimated fractiles. We point out that: (if it is desirable to consider a substantially richer set of distributions than the beta in developing PERT-type formulas; (ii) it may be beneficial to use more than three fractile-estimates in PERT-type formulas. We then develop formulas for estimating the mean and s.d. that are based on a substantially richer set of distributions than the beta and that use more than three estimated fractiles. These formulas perform better than the best currently-available formulas when the subjective distribution is not restricted to be beta.

J	Ulrich, KT; Pearson, S				Ulrich, KT; Pearson, S			Assessing the importance of design through product archaeology	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product design; design for manufacturing; competitive benchmarking; product development		This paper assesses the importance-of design in determining product costs by measuring the variation in design performance among a set of competing design efforts. This assessment is completed for a set of functionally similar products in a single product category: automatic drip coffee makers, The approach of this study is to measure the manufacturing content-the attributes of the design that drive cost-through analysis of the physical products themselves, and to estimate how variation in manufacturing content relates to variation in cost in a hypothetical manufacturing setting. We call this approach product archaeology. For the domain of coffee makers, we find significant variation in manufacturing content. This variation in manufacturing content corresponds to a range of estimated manufacturing casts, for a hypothetical manufacturing system, of approximately 50 percent of the average manufacturing cost of the products, We also find that differences in capabilities among product-development efforts are the most plausible explanation for the differences in manufacturing content.

Using a theoretical model and statistical analysis with empirical data from the four networks in the United States, we analyze the equilibrium achieved in this network monopolistic competition. Among other things, it is shown theoretically and empirically that in equilibrium all networks broadcast commercial breaks at the same time.

J	Martello, S; Vigo, D				Martello, S; Vigo, D			Exact solution of the Two-Dimensional Finite Bin Packing Problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						cutting and packing; branch-and-bound; worst-case analysis	2 DIMENSIONS; ALGORITHMS	Given a set of rectangular pieces to be cut from an unlimited number of standardized stock pieces (bins), the Two-Dimensional Finite Bin Packing Problem is to determine the minimum number of stock pieces that provide all the pieces. The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and finds many practical applications in the cutting and packing area. We analyze a well-known lower bound and determine its worst-case performance. We propose new lower bounds which are used within a branch-and-bound algorithm for the exact solution of the problem. Extensive computational testing on problem instances from the literature involving up to 120 pieces shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We develop a model that represents the dynamics of a health cafe unit. Then, to capture the essence of discharge decisions, we consider discharge policies that incorporate both the occupancy level of the unit and the status of patients measured by their stage of recovery and the time they have spent in that stage. We believe that our model tan be used as an aid to physicians and administrators to better assess discharge and/or capacity decisions. in addition, we investigate the impact of discharge decisions on the measures that represent the duality of care at a facility such as average hospital stays, system accessibility, and average complication risk of discharged patients. Our findings illustrate that inclusion of early discharge option improves system accessibility significantly and does not jeopardize care equity among patients. Furthermore, introduction of early discharge option has more pronounced effects on increasing care unit capacity than addition of open beds with no early discharges.

J	Piramuthu, S; Ragavan, H; Shaw, MJ				Piramuthu, S; Ragavan, H; Shaw, MJ			Using feature construction to improve the performance of neural networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						feature construction; neural networks; learning difficulty; financial credit-risk evaluation		Recent years have seen the growth in popularity of neural networks for business decision support because of their capabilities' for modeling, estimating, and classifying. Compared to other AI methods for problem solving such as expert systems, neural network approaches are especially useful far their ability to learn adaptively from observations. However, neural network learning performed by algorithms such as back-propagation (BP) are known to be slow due to the size of the search space involved and also the iterative manner in which the algorithm works. In this paper, we show that the degree of difficulty in neural network learning is inherent in the given set of training examples. We propose a technique for measuring such learning difficulty, and then develop a feature construction methodology that helps transform the training data so that both. the learning speed and classification accuracy of neural network algorithms are improved, We show the efficacy of the proposed method for financial risk classification, a domain characterized by frequent data noise, lack of functional structure, and high attribute interactions. Moreover, the empirical studies also provide insights into the structural characteristics of neural networks with respect to the input data used as well as possible mechanisms to improve the learning performance.

J	Lipscomb, J; Parmigiani, G; Hasselblad, V				Lipscomb, J; Parmigiani, G; Hasselblad, V			Combining expert judgment by hierarchical modeling: An application to physician staffing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						opinion pooling; hierarchical models; Bayesian inference; health workforce requirements	PROBABILITY	Expert panels are playing an increasingly important role in U.S. health policy decision making. A fundamental issue in these applications is how to synthesize the judgments of individual experts into a group judgment. In this paper we propose an approach to synthesis based on Bayesian hierarchical models, and apply it to the problem of determining physician staffing at medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). Our starting point is the supra-Bayesian approach to synthesis, whose principal motivation in the present context is to generate an estimate of the uncertainty associated with a panel's evaluation of the number of physicians required under specified conditions. Hierarchical models are particularly natural in this context since variability in the experts' judgments results in part from heterogeneity in their baseline experiences at different VA medical centers. We derive alternative hierarchical Bayes synthesis distributions for the number of physicians required to handle the (service-mix specific) daily workload in internal medicine at a given VA medical center (VAMC). The analysis appears to be the first to provide a statistical treatment of expert judgment processes for evaluating the appropriate use of resources in health care. Also, while hierarchical models are well established, their application to the synthesis of expert judgment is novel.

The product may start as a common single engine. As the product moves along manufacturing process, more features are added, and the product assumes more identities of the final end product. When demands of the end products are variable from period to period, the production volumes of the intermediate stages in the manufacturing process are also variable. It is widely recognized that variabilities of production volumes may add cost to the process. This paper is motivated by our observations in industry, where some companies have reengineered the manufacturing process by reversing two consecutive stages of the process. Such changes could lead to variance reduction, thereby improving the performance of the process. We develop formalized models that characterize the impact of such changes: operations reversal. These models are used to derive insights on when such reversal would be advisable.

J	Young, MR; DeSarbo, WS; Morwitz, VG				Young, MR; DeSarbo, WS; Morwitz, VG			The stochastic modeling of purchase intentions and behavior	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian methods; hierarchical bayes; markov chain Monte Carlo; measurement error; probit regression; purchase intentions; stochastic models	BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS; GIBBS SAMPLER; CONSUMER; REGRESSION; BINARY; BUY	A common objective of social science and business research is the modeling of the relationship between demographic/psychographic characteristics of individuals and the likelihood of certain behaviors for these same individuals. Frequently, data on actual behavior are unavailable; rather, one has available only the self-reported intentions of the individual. If the reported intentions imperfectly predict actual behavior, then any model of behavior based on the intention data should account for the associated measurement error, or else the resulting predictions will be biased. In this paper, we provide a method for analyzing intentions data that explicitly models the discrepancy between reported intention and behavior, thus facilitating a less biased assessment of the impact of designated covariates on actual behavior. The application examined here relates to modeling relationships between demographic characteristics and actual purchase behavior among consumers. A new Bayesian approach employing the Gibbs sampler is developed and compared to alternative models. We show, through simulated and real data, that, relative to methods that implicitly equate intentions and behavior, the proposed method can increase the accuracy with which purchase response models are estimated.

The user need not fully specify the joint distribution function; instead, the user "partially specifies" only the marginal distributions and the correlation matrix. The algorithm may be applied to any set of continuous, strictly increasing distribution functions; the marginal distributions need not all be of the same functional form. The correlation matrix is first checked for mathematical consistency (positive semi-definiteness), and adjusted if necessary. Then the correlated random vectors are generated using a combination of Cholesky decomposition and Gauss-Newton iteration. Applications are made to cost analysis, where correlations are often present between cost elements in a work breakdown structure.

J	Gallego, G				Gallego, G			New bounds and heuristics for (Q, r) policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; heuristics; bounds; minmax analysis; sensitivity analysis; stochastic models of inventory with fixed costs	STOCHASTIC INVENTORY SYSTEMS	To clarify the impact of demand variability on single item stochastic inventory systems with setup costs, we subsume the distributional information of the lead time demand into its mean and variance and solve the resulting problem against the worst possible distribution in this class. For (Q, r) policies we obtain in closed form a distribution-free solution for Q and r, and upper bounds on the optimal long run average cost and on the optimal batch size. As a byproduct we develop a robust, distribution-free, batch size heuristic that causes a relative cost increase of no more than 6.07%. In addition, when the newsvendor cost is known, we obtain sharper lower and upper bounds on the long run average cost. These bounds clarify, in an exceedingly simple way, the cost impact of fixed setup costs, demand variability, and constraints on the batch size. We illustrate our bounds and heuristics on problems with Poisson and Compound Poisson demands.

The estimators are based on L-p norms of standardized time series, and they generalize previously studied estimators due to Schruben. We show that the new estimators have some desirable properties: they are asymptotically unbiased and have low asymptotic variance. We also illustrate empirically the performance of the L-p-norm estimators on various stochastic processes.

J	Rump, CM; Stidham, S				Rump, CM; Stidham, S			Stability and chaos in input pricing for a service facility with adaptive customer response to congestion	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						optimal pricing; service facility; optimal design of queues; stable equilibrium; chaos	FLOW-CONTROL; SYSTEMS; QUEUES	We consider the stability of the equilibrium arrival rate and equilibrium admission price at a service facility, using a generalization of an input-pricing model introduced by Dewan and Mendelson and further examined by Stidham. At the equilibrium, the marginal value of service equals the admission price, that is, the sum of the admission fee and the expected delay cost. Stability means (roughly) that the system returns to the equilibrium after a perturbation, assuming the customers base their join/balk decisions on previous prices. We extend the discrete-time, dynamic-system pricing model of Stidham to allow adaptive expectations in which customers predict the future price based on a convex combination of the current price and the previous prediction. We show that this can lead to chaotic behavior when the equilibrium is unstable. That is, the price and arrival rate can follow aperiodic orbits, which appear to be completely random. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for observed variations in the mean arrival rate to a queueing system, which are often modeled by means of a random exogenous (e.g., Markovian) environment process.

We develop a new variable depth search procedure, GLS (Guided Local Search), based on an interchange scheme and using the new concept of neighborhood trees. Structural properties of the neighborhood are used to guide the search in promising directions. While this procedure competes successfully with others even as a stand-alone, a hybrid procedure that embeds GLS into a Shifting Bottleneck framework and takes advantage of the differences between the two neighborhood structures proves to be particularly efficient. We report extensive computational testing on all the problems available from the literature.

The role of returns policies in pricing and inventory decisions for catalogue goods	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; returns policies; newsboy; manufacturing/marketing interface; supply chain	DEMAND	Manufacturers often use returns policies to encourage retailers to stock and price items more aggressively. We focus on the effect that such policies have on both a retailer's and a manufacturer's profits when the retailer must commit prior to the selling season to both a stocking quantity and a price at which to sell an item. Such a commitment is often necessary for retailers who sell primarily through catalogues.

In a path-analytic model, R&D intensity was significantly associated with improvements in market share (R-2 = 34%), controlling for firm size, previous market share, and regardless of industry or region of the world. Market share increases were also significantly correlated with improvements in manufacturing agility (R-2 = 4%). Agility improvement was significantly correlated with R&D intensity, and computerization in manufacturing, controlling for firm size and region, and did exhibit industry effects, with electronic equipment firms elevated on this measure. Computerization exhibited regional (not industry) differences, with South American firms depressed on this measure. The role of computerization in manufacturing and agility in firm innovativeness are discussed.

Managers must consider the impact of future technologies while making acquisition and replacement decisions in such environments. We consider a problem where a sequence of technological breakthroughs are anticipated but their magnitude and timing are uncertain. A firm, operating in such an environment, must decide how much capacity of the current technology to acquire to meet future demand growth. It must also determine whether to upgrade any of the older vintages. We formulate this problem and present some structural results. Using these results, we then develop a highly efficient regeneration point-based dynamic programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through a computational study. The sensitivity of the first period decision to various parameters is also explored.

J	KLaassen, P				KLaassen, P			Financial asset-pricing theory and stochastic programming models for asset/liability management: A synthesis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic programming; asset/liability management; asset pricing theory; aggregation methods	TRANSACTIONS COSTS; LINEAR-PROGRAMS; REPLICATION; BOUNDS; DECOMPOSITION; AGGREGATION; CONSUMPTION; TIME	Practical portfolio investment problems under uncertainty can be modeled well as multiperiod stochastic programs. However, the numerical optimization methods that need to be used to solve such models seriously limit the level of detail in the uncertainty about future asset prices and returns that can be incorporated. Somewhat surprisingly, the question how this necessarily approximate description of the uncertainty should be constructed has received relatively little attention in the stochastic programming literature. Moreover, many of the descriptions that have been used are not arbitrage-free, and therefore inconsistent with modern financial asset-pricing theory. In this paper we will present aggregation methods that tan be used in combination with financial asset-pricing models to obtain a description of the uncertainty that is arbitrage-free, consistent with observed market prices as well as concise enough for a stochastic programming model. Furthermore, we will discuss how these aggregation methods can form the basis of an iterative solution approach.

Nonparametric estimators (DEA, FDH,...) are based on a finite sample of observed production units. The bootstrap is one easy way to analyze the sensitivity of efficiency scores relative to the sampling variations of the estimated frontier. The main point in order to validate the bootstrap is to define a reasonable data-generating process in this complex framework and to propose a reasonable estimator of it. This paper provides a general methodology of bootstrapping in nonparametric frontier models. Some adapted methods are illustrated in analyzing the bootstrap sampling variations of input efficiency measures of electricity plants.

We build a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of a firm's reputation for being a credible defender of its markets. Theory and limited empirical evidence suggests a firm with this reputation should deter competitive attacks against it. We explore how a manager's competitive cognition about her opponents' (1) patterns of activity in the marketplace and (2) previous success can lead her to perceive a competitor as a credible defender. We test the framework using MBA students in a quasi-field setting, the Markstrat2 simulation game. The results of this study suggest that reputation deters attack only when the potential attacker considers the target firm a minor competitor. Managers consider defenders that have previously been successful as credible defenders of their markets. They also weigh consistency of activity relative to industry average in making inferences about credibility. The study indicates that the deterrence-reputation link is more complex than previous theory and evidence might imply, and suggests considerable promise for a psychological approach to examining competitive interactions.

J	Reddy, SK; Aronson, JE; Stam, A				Reddy, SK; Aronson, JE; Stam, A			SPOT: Scheduling programs optimally for television	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						television network scheduling; generalized networks; integer programming; judgmental models	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; AUDIENCE; MODELS	This paper introduces SPOT (Scheduling Programs Optimally for Television), an analytical model for optimal prime-time TV program scheduling. Due in part to the advent of new cable TV channels, the competition for viewer ratings has intensified substantially in recent years, and the revenues of the major networks have not kept pace with the costs of the programs. As profit margins decrease, the networks seek to improve their viewer ratings with innovative scheduling strategies. Our SPOT models for scheduling network programs combine predicted ratings for different combinations of prime-time schedules with a novel, mixed-integer, generalized network-based flow, mathematical programming model which when solved provides an optimal schedule. In addition to historical performance, subjective inputs from actual network managers were used as input to the network flow optimization model. The optimization model is flexible. It can utilize the managers' input and maximize profit (instead of ratings) by considering not only the revenue potential but also the costs of the shows. Moreover, SPOT can describe the scheduling problem over any time period (e.g., day, week, month, season), and designate certain shows to, and restrict them from, given time slots. The methodology of SPOT is illustrated using data for the first quarter of 1990, obtained from a cable network. The optimization model produces solutions that would have generated an increase of approximately 2% in overall profitability, representing over $6 million annually for the cable network. SPOT not only produces more profitable TV schedules for this network, but also provides valuable general insights into the development of mixed programming strategies for improving future schedules.

We propose an effective branch-and-cut approach for solving single-product ASDPs, adapting inequalities known to be valid for embedded line balancing structures to form inequalities that are valid for the ASDP. The implementation also involves a specialized preprocessor, a heuristic, separation procedures, and an enumeration scheme. Computational tests establish benchmark results for this first implementation of cutting planes for solving the ASDP.

Once the market capacity becomes publicly known, each player must decide privately whether to enter the market and receive a payoff, which increases linearly in the difference between the market capacity and the number of entrants, or stay out. Payoffs for staying out are either positive, giving rise to the domain of gains, or negative, giving rise to the domain of losses. The major findings are substantial individual differences that do not diminish with practice, aggregate behavior that is organized extremely well in both the domains of gains and losses by the Nash equilibrium solution, and variations in the population action strategies with repeated play of the stage game that are accounted for by a variant of an adaptive learning model due to Roth and Erev (1995).

J	Thonemann, UW; Brandeau, ML				Thonemann, UW; Brandeau, ML			Note. Optimal storage assignment policies for automated storage and retrieval systems with stochastic demands	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						manufacturing; automated systems		In existing AS/RS research, storage assignment policies are evaluated based on the probability that item type j will be stored (and subsequently retrieved). This note applies the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies of Hausman et al. (1976) to a stochastic environment by identifying the kth pallet of item type j: Frequently demanded pallets are stored close to the input/output point and rarely demanded pallets are stored at the end of the storage rack. We consider a discrete storage rack and a continuous storage rack. For the continuous rack case, we develop an expression for expected one-way travel time given uniform and exponentially distributed demand. We show that the turnover-based policy applied to the stochastic environment is optimal(it minimizes one-way travel time) and that both the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies applied in the stochastic environment reduce expected storage/retrieval time compared with random assignment. These savings can be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems and can be used to improve the design of proposed systems.

J	Desiraju, R; Moorthy, S				Desiraju, R; Moorthy, S			Managing a distribution channel under asymmetric information with performance requirements	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pay-for-performance; distribution channels	VERTICAL RESTRAINTS; COORDINATION; CONTRACTS	In this paper we study how performance requirements may improve the working of a distribution channel when the retailer is better informed about demand conditions than the manufacturer. Performance requirements means that the manufacturer and retailer agree to (1) have the manufacturer set requirements on retail price or service or both, and (2) jointly invest in the information systems required to monitor the retailer's compliance with the requirements. We show that performance requirements on price and service will improve channel performance. But if requirements cannot be set on both performance dimensions, the choice among the remaining options is not straightforward Price requirements may be worse than no requirements, and service requirements no better. The central problem with setting requirements on only one dimension is that the retailer then behaves suboptimally on the other. Between the two partial options, service requirements are better than price requirements in aligning the interests of the manufacturer and the retailer, whereas price requirements are better at inducing the retailer to reveal his demand.

We examine the optical character recognition and barcode sorting technologies in the mail sorting process at the United States Postal Service. Our analysis is at the application level, and thus does not involve the aggregation of IT impact over multiple processes. We use data from 46 mail processing centers over 3 years to study the IT impact. We also use a set of factors in our model to account for differences in input characteristics. Our results show that mail sorting output significantly increases with higher use of IT. In addition, IT improves quality which in turn enhances output. We also find that input characteristics exert considerable influence in determining the output and quality of the mail sorting operation. For example, while absenteeism tends to decrease output and quality due to its disruptive consequences, a higher fraction of barcoded mail seems to enhance both performance measures.

J	Dewan, S; Min, CK				Dewan, S; Min, CK			The substitution of information technology for other factors of production: A firm level analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information technology; productivity; substitutability; computers; IT investments; productivity paradox	TRANSLOG; ENERGY	Fueled by its constant technological and price improvements, information technology (IT) is displacing other inputs in the production of goods and services. By 1994, IT accounts for over 15% of fixed investments by the U.S. private sector, and the ratio of new IT investments to labor costs is approaching 5% (1990 dollar basis). The ability to take advantage of improvements in IT is determined in part by the substitutability of IT for other factors of production. This paper builds on the empirical framework of Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1995) and extends it to jointly estimate output and substitution elasticities using the CES-translog production function. Our primary source of IT-related data is the IDG/Computerworld annual survey data on IS spending by large U.S. firms, for the period 1988 to 1992, previously analyzed by Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1995, 1996) and Lichtenberg (1995). A key result is that IT capital is a net substitute for both ordinary capital and labor, suggesting that the factor share of IT in production will grow to more significant levels over time. We confirm earlier findings of positive returns to IT investment for this data set. Further, we find excess returns on IT investment relative to labor input and some evidence of excess returns relative to ordinary capital. Taken together, these results shed new light on the productivity paradox of IT and on the growth of information intensity across the economy as firms take advantage of the continuing improvements in IT.

J	Bakos, JY				Bakos, JY			Reducing buyer search costs: Implications for electronic marketplaces	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						electronic markets; search costs; consumer search; electronic commerce; Internet markets	TECHNOLOGY	Information systems can serve as intermediaries between the buyers and the sellers in a market, creating an "electronic marketplace" that lowers the buyers' cost to acquire information about seller prices and product offerings. As a result, electronic marketplaces reduce the inefficiencies caused by buyer search costs, in the process reducing the ability of sellers to extract monopolistic profits while increasing the ability of markets to optimally allocate productive resources. This article models the role of buyer search costs in markets with differentiated product offerings. The impact of reducing these search costs is analyzed in the context of an electronic marketplace, and the allocational efficiencies such a reduction can bring to a differentiated market are formalized. The resulting implications for the incentives of buyers, sellers, and independent intermediaries to invest in electronic marketplaces are explored. Finally, the possibility to separate price information from product attribute information is introduced, and the implications of designing markets promoting competition along each of these dimensions are discussed.

J	Clemons, EK; Weber, BW				Clemons, EK; Weber, BW			Information technology and screen-based securities trading: Pricing the stock and pricing the trade	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						design of securities exchanges; screening and signaling mechanisms; information asymmetry; electronic trading	MARKET	Many major stock exchanges rely on their member firms to act as dealer intermediaries, risking their own capital to trade as dealers with investor customers. A confluence of forces will dramatically alter the role of these intermediaries and the strategies available to-them. Information technology is increasing the diversity of trading strategies used by investors; these impose different costs and risks upon intermediaries. Alternative electronic trading venues-off-exchange trading systems-are increasing the competition faced by established exchanges, and have been especially effective in targeting investors who impose low risks upon intermediaries. Finally, many of the automated systems developed by existing exchanges have stripped of many of the cues that have in the past been used by intermediaries to assess the riskiness of an investor's trade and to price accordingly. We believe that competitive pressure from alternative trading venues will drive exchanges to develop mechanisms to support risk-based pricing. We explore, through a stylized model of trading, how the use of risk-based pricing can preserve the established central market. This enables intermediaries to separate pricing the shares traded from pricing the services for dealing these shares, and provides low-cost execution while preserving the benefits of intermediation. Our model uses a detailed computer simulation, in which dealers interact with order flow to produce a sequence of trades, which determine market prices, which in turn influence order flow; the model enables us to calculate trading costs for different classes of investor, various other standard measures of market quality, and market maker profitability.

Productivity gains in software maintenance can enable redeployment of Information Systems resources to other activities. Thus, it is important to understand how software maintenance productivity can be improved. In this study, we investigate the relationship between project size and software maintenance productivity. We explore scale economies in software maintenance by examining a number of software enhancement projects at a large financial services organization. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the functional relationship between maintenance inputs and outputs and employ DEA-based statistical tests to evaluate returns to scale for the projects. Our results indicate the presence of significant scale economies in software maintenance, and are robust to a number of sensitivity checks. For our sample of projects, there is the potential to reduce software maintenance costs 36% by batching smaller modification projects into larger planned releases. We conclude by rationalizing why the software managers at our research site do not take advantage of scale economies in software maintenance. Our analysis considers the opportunity costs of delaying projects to batch them into larger size projects as a potential explanation for the managers' behavior.

J	Wang, ETG; Barron, T; Seidmann, A				Wang, ETG; Barron, T; Seidmann, A			Contracting structures for custom software development: The impacts of informational rents and uncertainty on internal development and outsourcing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software development; outsourcing; bargaining; revelation principle; relationship-specific investment; externalities; informational asymmetry	COST	Custom software development projects have special informational attributes that have challenged managers for many years: they are associated with information asymmetries regarding user valuation and developer costs, relationship-specific investments, and a resulting likelihood of positive externalities for the user or the developer from the other party's investment. Furthermore, in a custom project, market prices for software are not helpful in solving either the valuation or the cost problems. In this paper we analyze the unique nature of the software development agreements that can be reached between the user and the developer in such a setting. We compare the value of using internal and external developers, with the goal of better understanding the factors relevant to the outsourcing decision. For internal development, we derive a new mechanism that achieves the first-best system whenever the project has positive expected net value, while achieving ex ante budget balance. In contrast, the optimal mechanism for an external developer will not in general yield the first-best system. This implies that when internal and external developers have identical cost functions, internal development definitely yields the larger net value. More generally, this implies that an external developer must have considerable cost advantages over an internal developer in order to have the larger net value. Numerical results indicate that this difference in net values can be very large, as much as a 100% increase for internal development over external development. This is consistent with the strong bias in favor of internal custom development found in recent empirical studies. We also explain why the efficient levels of investment can be achieved only when there are no externalities, and we show that the presence of positive externalities results in underinvestment. Since using an external developer will typically yield a system that is not first-best, inefficient investments result with or without externalities. We present examples showing that uncertainty about system value is not a significant factor in choosing between internal and external development. However, uncertainty about the development costs is highly significant, with greater uncertainty making outsourcing less attractive.

We use a model of the production of information services based on the economic theory of production to develop testable hypotheses for budget behavior. In particular, we focus on two important issues: (1) the allocation of the information systems budget to its two largest components-personnel and hardware, and (2) the existence of scale economies in the provision of information services. These issues are examined using budget data collected through a survey of information systems managers in Fortune 500 corporations. We find that the optimal ratio of personnel to hardware expenditures is independent of the scale of the information systems organization for a given set of prices, and that there are no measurable economies of scale in the provision of information services. The implications of the analysis for the management of information services are discussed.

J	Eppen, GD; Iyer, AV				Eppen, GD; Iyer, AV			Backup agreements in fashion buying - The value of upstream flexibility	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory; lead time; Bayesian updating; fashion buying; backup agreements		We focus on backup agreements between a catalog company and manufacturers-a scheme to provide upstream sourcing flexibility for fashion merchandise. A backup agreement states that if the catalog company commits to a number of units for the season, the manufacturer holds back a constant fraction of the commitment and delivers the remaining units before the start of the fashion season. After observing early demand, the catalog company can order up to this backup quantity for the original purchase cost and receive quick delivery but will pay a penalty cost for any of the backup units it does not buy. In representative contracts with five companies, the fraction held as backup varies from 20% to 33% and the penalty ranges from 0 to 20% of cost. We model this inventory problem and derive the optimal solution. We provide results from a retrospective parallel test of the model against buyer decisions in 1993 based on a data set from the women's fashion department at a catalog company (Catco). The results indicate that backup arrangements can have a substantial impact on expected profits and may result in an increase in the committed quantity. Also, these arrangements may maintain the manufacturer's expected profit for a wide range of parameters.

The new code fully exploits the advantages of 32-bit programming provided by recent compilers running on platforms such as Windows NT(R) and OS/2(R): flat memory, increased addressable memory, and fast program execution. We study the impact of three important variables on the computation time for the RCPSP: addressable computer memory, the search strategy (depth-first, best-first, or hybrid), and the introduction of a stronger lower bound. We compare the results obtained by a truncated branch-and-bound procedure with the results generated by the minimum slack time heuristic and report on the dependency of its solution quality on the allotted CPU time.

Hypotheses drawn from the resource-based view of the firm, from network theory, and from Austrian economics are tested on objective cross-section and time-series data for the population of 4,088 banks engaged in foreign-exchange trading on the Reuters dealing system. Results strongly support the hypotheses that banks that are alert, i.e., use their information networks in ways that expand the range of information they are exposed to, and responsive-those that act quickly in volatile markets-tend to exercise greater market influence in this industry.

J	VanderWerf, PA; Mahon, JF				VanderWerf, PA; Mahon, JF			Meta-analysis of the impact of research methods on findings of first-mover advantage	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						first-mover advantage; market pioneer; metaanalysis	MARKET PIONEER ADVANTAGES; 1ST-MOVER ADVANTAGE; GOODS INDUSTRIES; CONSUMER-GOODS; ENTRY ORDER; SHARE; BRANDS; TIME; 1ST	A long-standing hypothesis is that firms that enter a market early (''first movers'') tend to have higher performance than their followers (''first-mover advantage''). Recently, researchers have begun to argue that the statistical tests that support this relationship are limited in their applicability. That is, it is suggested that because of the methods used, these tests show the relationship only for certain subsets of firms, markets, and types of performance. We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether the findings are in fact sensitive to the methods used. We discovered that tests using market share as their performance measure were sharply and significantly more likely to find a first-mover advantage than tests using other measures (such as profitability or survival). Also significantly more likely to find an advantage were tests that sample from individually selected industries and those that include no measures of the entrants' competitive strength. Conversely, we found little evidence that ''survivor bias'' (the exclusion of nonsurviving entrants from the sample) affects a test's findings. The data further suggest that tests that use none of the questioned research practices will find a first-mover advantage no more often than can be accounted for by random statistical error alone.

J	Fischetti, M; Toth, P				Fischetti, M; Toth, P			A polyhedral approach to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						traveling salesman problem; branch-and-cut algorithms; separation; computational analysis	BOUND ALGORITHM; LARGE-SCALE; POLYTOPE; FACETS; BRANCH; INEQUALITIES	Several branch-and-bound algorithms for the exact solution of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP), based on the assignment problem (AP) relaxation, have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms perform very well for some instances (e.g., those with uniformly random integer costs), but very poorly for others. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of a branch-and-cut algorithm exploiting ATSP-specific facet-defining cuts, to be used to attack hard instances that cannot be solved by the AP-based procedures from the literature. We present new separation algorithms for some classes of facet-defining cuts, and a new variable-pricing technique for dealing with highly degenerate primal LP problems. A branch-and-cut algorithm based on these new results is designed and evaluated through computational analysis on several classes of both random and real-world instances. The outcome of the research is that, on hard instances, the branch-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms the best AP-based algorithms from the literature.

J	Balvers, RJ; Mitchell, DW				Balvers, RJ; Mitchell, DW			Autocorrelated returns and optimal intertemporal portfolio choice	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic portfolio choice; autocorrelated returns; age effects; dollar-cost averaging	MEAN REVERSION; STOCK RETURNS; PRICES; MODEL	In recent years it has been shown empirically that stock returns exhibit positive or negative autocorrelation, depending on observation frequency. In this context of autocorrelated returns the present paper is the first to derive an explicit analytical solution to the dynamic portfolio problem of an individual agent saving for retirement (or other change of status, like the purchase of a house or starting college). Using a normal ARMA(1, 1) process, dynamic programming techniques combined with the use of Stein's Lemma are employed to examine ''dollar-cost-averaging'' and ''age effects'' in intertemporal portfolio choice with CARA preferences. We show that with a positive moving average parameter and positive risk free rates, if first-order serial correlation is nonnegative, then the expected value of the optimal risky investment is increasing over time, while if first-order serial correlation is negative this path can be increasing or decreasing over time. Thus a necessary but not sufficient condition to obtain the conventional age effect of increasing conservatism over time is that first-order serial correlation be negative. Further, dollar-cost averaging in the general sense of gradual entry into the risky asset does not emerge as an optimal policy. Simulation results for U.S. data are used to illustrate optimal portfolio paths.		Balvers, RJ (reprint author), W VIRGINIA UNIV,DEPT ECON,MORGANTOWN,WV 26506, USA.

J	Wathieu, L				Wathieu, L			Habits and the anomalies in intertemporal choice	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						intertemporal choice; habit formation; discounted utility; decreasing impatience; negative time preference; dynamic consistency	TIME PREFERENCE; DISCOUNT RATES; DECISIONS; DEMAND	This paper analyzes a model of discounted utility under habit formation. Habit formation means that utility in each period is determined by the difference between the received outcome and the customary outcome at that point in time. Preferences are rational, in the sense that the decision maker correctly anticipates the habit formation process and behaves in a dynamically consistent manner, i.e., plans are truly carried out. The purpose is to demonstrate that this generalization of the discounted utility model accounts, jointly and in a meaningful way, for the most striking anomalies with respect to classical discounted utility theory. The common difference effect is explained first. This effect, also called decreasing impatience effect, has usually been viewed as evidence against exponential discounting. Then, the frequently observed preference for increasing sequences of outcomes is examined. Such preference, under the traditional discounted utility model, would be regarded as a paradoxical case of negative discounting. A discussion of the descriptive, prescriptive, and normative values of the model is included.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stock index futures; volatility spillovers; extreme value estimators; vector autoregression	EXTREME-VALUE METHOD; TIME-SERIES; RETURN VARIANCES; OCTOBER 1987; UNIT-ROOT; ARBITRAGE; TRANSMISSION; INFORMATION; ESTIMATORS; LINKAGES	The international transmission of intraday price volatility among the United States, United Kingdom, and Japanese stock index futures markets in the period 1988-1994 is investigated in this paper. The empirical results based on extreme-value estimators and vector autoregression indicate the rapid transmission of information between markets. The volatilities of the U.S. and U.K. futures markets appear to follow a meteor shower rather than a heat wave type of process. This means that these volatilities react to shocks from other markets, i.e., they cannot be described only by their past values. However, the heat wave hypothesis is not rejected for the Japanese market, meaning that the shocks to Japanese volatility are mostly country-specific. A multivariate GARCH model supports the U.K. and Japanese but not the U.S. results.

J	Moinzadeh, K; Aggarwal, P				Moinzadeh, K; Aggarwal, P			Analysis of a production/inventory system subject to random disruptions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						production inventory systems; random disruptions; operating characteristics; stocking policies	MACHINE BREAKDOWNS; INVENTORY; POLICIES	In this paper we study an unreliable bottleneck production/inventory system with a constant production and demand rate that is subject to random disruptions. We assume that the restoration times are constant, the time between breakdowns is exponential, the production setup cost and/or setup time is positive, and excess demand is backordered. We propose an (s, S) production policy for such systems and develop expressions for the operating characteristics of the system. The properties of the policy parameters that minimize the expected total cost rate are investigated and a procedure for finding their optimal values is developed. In addition, we devise and test a simple heuristic procedure for finding near optimal production policies. The results of a numerical experiment suggest that: (i) setup cost reduction is more effective in reducing total operating cost when the production system is more reliable, (ii) setup cost reduction in unreliable production systems results in higher optimal safety stock level, and (iii) proper determination of the safety stock levels is extremely important in Just-in-Time systems, which are susceptible to disruptions.

Monte Carlo simulation, however, has not been used to its fullest extent for option valuation because of the belief that the method is not feasible for American-style options. This paper demonstrates how to incorporate optimal early exercise in the Monte Carlo method of valuing options by linking forward-moving simulation and the backward-moving recursion of dynamic programming through an iterative search process. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we use it to value American-style options on the average price (or Asian options). The computational experience reveals a flexible valuation technique with potential for application to a range of securities and financial decision problems.

Dynamic conjectural variations in a Lanchester oligopoly	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; advertising; competitive strategy; games; differential; noncooperative	ADVERTISING STRATEGIES; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; DUOPOLY; MODELS	An approach based on dynamic conjectural variations is advanced for developing dynamic advertising strategies in a Lanchester oligopoly differential game. The approach allows competitors to anticipate rival reactions to market-share state variables, and maintains the computational advantage of open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. In an empirical application to the ready-to-eat cereal industry, it is shown that advertising strategies based on dynamic conjectural variations can better explain the advertising of the cereal competitors than can open-loop advertising strategies.

J	Parlar, M; Weng, ZK				Parlar, M; Weng, ZK			Designing a firm's coordinated manufacturing and supply decisions with short product life cycles	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						coordination; supply chain; newsboy model	DISCOUNT PRICING MODEL; QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; ECONOMIES; POLICIES; PROFITS; DEMAND	In this paper we consider a problem of joint coordination between a firm's manufacturing and supply departments. The manufacturing department is responsible for meeting random demand of a product with a short life cycle. The supply department's responsibility is to provide the sufficient amount of raw materials so that the required production level can be achieved. When coordination prevails, both departments' decisions are jointly made; otherwise, decisions are made independently without an exchange of information. If the random demand exceeds the amount produced, a second production nm can be expedited at a substantially higher cost. Our analysis yields insightful results to such a coordination problem between the two departments. We provide conditions under which it is desirable to coordinate, resulting in a significant increase in expected profit. If coordination is optimal, then the supply department would purchase additional reserved material for the second run. Under this scenario, we analyze the effects of joint coordination on the expected profit. We also find explicit conditions for which joint coordination is not beneficial, i.e., the supply department should only order sufficient material to meet the first production nm requirements. We provide a detailed set of numerical examples and generate response surfaces indicating the desirability of coordination for different pairs of parameter combinations.

J	Fichman, RG; Kemerer, CF				Fichman, RG; Kemerer, CF			The assimilation of software process innovations: An organizational learning perspective	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software process innovation; adoption; diffusion; assimilation; organizational learning; object-oriented programming; object orientation; disk-based survey	CASE TOOL ADOPTION; DIFFUSION	The burden of organizational learning surrounding software process innovations (SPIs)-and complex organizational technologies in general-creates a ''knowledge barrier'' that inhibits diffusion. Attewell (1992) has suggested that many organizations will defer adoption until knowledge barriers have been sufficiently lowered; however, this leaves open the question of which organizations should be more likely to innovate, even in face of high knowledge barriers. It is proposed here that organizations will innovate in the presence of knowledge barriers when the burden of organizational learning is effectively lower, either because much of the required know-how already exists within the organization, or because such knowledge can be acquired more easily or more economically. Specifically, it is hypothesized that organizations will have a greater propensity to initiate and sustain the assimilation of SPIs when they have a greater scale of activities over which learning costs can be spread (learning-related scale), more extensive existing knowledge related to the focal innovation (related knowledge), and a greater diversity of technical knowledge and activities (diversity). An empirical study using data on the assimilation of object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs) by 608 information technology organizations strongly confirmed the importance of the three hypothesized factors in explaining the assimilation of OOPLs.

J	Caulkins, JP				Caulkins, JP			Modeling the domestic distribution network for illicit drugs	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						drug policy; criminal justice; distribution; networks		This paper presents a simple economic model of a drug dealer's decision about how many customers to supply. The model relates the number of customers (i.e., the branching factor of the distribution network) to a quantity discount factor describing the extent to which prices are marked up from one distribution level to the next and the ratio of selling costs to product costs. Solving the model allows one to infer characteristics of the domestic distribution network from more readily observable characteristics of the markets and, thereby, to gain insight into how drug control interventions might work.

J	Duenyas, I; Hopp, WJ; Bassok, Y				Duenyas, I; Hopp, WJ; Bassok, Y			Production quotas as bounds on interplant JIT contracts	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pull systems; just-in-time; production control; supply chain management	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; UNCERTAIN DEMAND; RANDOM OUTAGES; OPTIMALITY; POLICIES; CAPACITY	We consider the situation of a supplier plant whose customer plants desire just-in-time (JIT) deliveries. Randomness in both the production and demand processes make satisfying every demand that might occur in true JIT fashion impossible. Therefore, supplier plants typically negotiate bounds on JIT contracts with their customers. In this paper, we focus on the use Of ''quotas'' or ''target inventory levels'' as a mechanism for establishing such bounds. That is, the supplier firm is responsible for meeting periodic demands up to the quota, but not beyond. In this paper, we consider the problem of setting an appropriate quota from the perspective of the supplier plant and interpret our results in the context of the negotiation process between the supplier and its customers. Under the assumption that ''safety capacity'' (i.e., overtime or a vendoring option) is available, we develop two models that address this problem. The first model assumes that quota shortfalls cannot be carried over to the next regular time production period and are made up with overtime/vendoring, which incurs fixed plus variable costs. The second model assumes that shortages can be backlogged to the next regular time production period at a cost. We use numerical examples to demonstrate how the models we developed were used by a clutch supplier to a large auto manufacturer to negotiate its JIT contracts.

J	Gorn, GJ; Chattopadhyay, A; Yi, T; Dahl, DW				Gorn, GJ; Chattopadhyay, A; Yi, T; Dahl, DW			Effects of color as an executional cue in advertising: They're in the shade	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; advertising and media; buyer behavior	PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL; AD RESPONSE; MEDIATOR; ATTITUDE; EMOTIONS; IMPACT	In designing print ads, one of the decisions the advertiser must make is which color(s) to use as executional cues in the ad. Typically, color decisions are based on intuition and anecdotal evidence. To provide guidelines for these decisions, this research proposes and tests a conceptual framework linking the hue, chroma, and value of the color(s) in an ad to consumers' feelings and attitudes. In an experimental study, the three dimensions of color used in an ad are manipulated using a between-subjects design. The results support the hypotheses that ads containing colors with a higher level of value lead to greater liking for the ad, and this effect is mediated by the greater feelings of relaxation elicited by the higher value color. Feelings play an equally important role in the effect of chroma. Consistent with the hypotheses, higher levels of chroma elicit greater feelings of excitement, which in turn increase ad likeability. A follow-up study found that although managers often select higher value and higher chroma colors, in a large number of cases they do not. The findings of both studies are integrated in our discussion of the importance of value and chroma in increasing the range of options available to a manager faced with the selection of colors in an ad.

J	Desai, PS				Desai, PS			Advertising fee in business-format franchising	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						channels of distribution; franchising	CHANNEL COORDINATION; CONTRACTS	Most franchisors charge an advertising fee in addition to the better known royalty and franchise fee. We study the role of the advertising fee in improving channel coordination. We begin our analysis with a simple case of one franchisor dealing with two identical franchisees and find that the advertising fee allows the franchisor to commit to a specific level of advertising spending at the time of contract acceptance. We also find that the lump-sum advertising fee is better than the sales-based advertising fee. These results are intriguing because most franchisors use the sales-based advertising fee. We show that when franchisees' markets differ in how advertising affects sales, the franchisor may prefer the sales-based advertising fee. There are two reasons for the higher profitability of the sales-based advertising fee. First, the sales-based advertising fee conditions the franchisor's advertising decision on the franchisees' price and service decisions, and induces them to make better price and service decisions. The second reason is that with heterogeneous franchisees, using the sales-based advertising fee does not increase the total sales-based component in the fee structure. These results also hold when the franchisor pledges to contribute a matching fraction of the advertising fee to the advertising fund.

J	Stafira, S; Parnell, GS; Moore, JT				Stafira, S; Parnell, GS; Moore, JT			A methodology for evaluating military systems in a counterproliferation role	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision analysis; arms control; defense analysis; public policy analysis		This paper illustrates a methodology to evaluate how dissimilar military systems support the accomplishment of the United States' counterproliferation objectives. The key questions in evaluating counterproliferation systems are identified. By using decision analysis, an influence diagram model is developed that represents military activities in the counterproliferation process. A value model is developed that enables systems to be evaluated against common criteria. An analysis of intelligence, defensive, and offensive counterproliferation systems suggests that intelligence system improvements may provide the greatest potential to meet the United States' counterproliferation objectives. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine which factors in the model are most important. To demonstrate the model, nine systems from the Air Force Vulcan's Forge 1995 wargame are evaluated. This paper illustrates the value of decision analysis, and influence diagrams in particular, by involving decision makers and subject matter experts in structuring complex problems for analysis.

J	Lamar, BW; Wallace, CA				Lamar, BW; Wallace, CA			Revised-modified penalties for fixed charge transportation problems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						branch-and-bound; conditional penalties; fixed charge transportation problem; mixed integer programming; up and down penalties	BOUND ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION	Conditional penalties are used to obtain lower bounds to subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure that can be tighter than the LP relaxation of the subproblems. For the fixed charge transportation problem (FCTP), branch-and-bound algorithms have been implemented using conditional penalties proposed by Driebeek (1966), Cabot and Erenguc (1984), and Palekar et al. (1990). The last conditional penalties are referred to as the ''modified'' penalties. In this paper, we show that the modified penalties are not valid conditional penalties. In fact, in nearly a quarter of the test problems examined, the modified penalties prevented the branch-and-bound algorithm from properly identifying the optimal solution to the FCTP. A simple change, which corrects a subcase in the penalty calculation, restores the validity of the modified penalties while retaining their efficiency. Computational tests indicate that the ''revised-modified'' penalties continue to dominate the Driebeek and the Cabot and Erenguc penalties.

J	Simaan, Y				Simaan, Y			Estimation risk in portfolio selection: The mean variance model versus the mean absolute deviation model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						portfolio analysis; estimation risk; mean-variance portfolio analysis; investment analysis		Konno and Yamazaki (1992) propose the mean absolute deviation (MAD) model as an alternative to the mean variance (MV) model. They claim it retains all the positive features of the MV model, saves the investor computing time, and does not require the covariance matrix. This paper shows that ignoring the covariance matrix results in greater estimation risk that outweighs the benefits. In both models, estimation error is more;severe in small samples (small. observations relative to the number of assets) and for investors with high risk tolerance. The MV model's lower estimation risk is most striking in small samples and for investors with a low risk tolerance.

J	Joglekar, P; Bohl, AH; Hamburg, M				Joglekar, P; Bohl, AH; Hamburg, M			Fortune favors the prepared firm - Comments	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						innovation; technological change; expectational formation; absorptive capacity		A recent paper in Management Science titled ''Fortune Favors the Prepared Firm'' (Cohen and Levinthal 1994) is a pioneering work insofar as it introduces the concept of a firm's absorptive capacity-the ability to evaluate, assimilate, and exploit extramural technological developments. We appreciate the paper's extensive qualitative discussion of the nature and role of absorptive capacity. We also commend the authors' idea of constructing a mathematical model to analyze a rational firm's incentives for an investment in absorptive capacity. However, we find that the authors' model overlooks one key element of a firm's absorptive capacity, namely, the firm's ability to defend itself against the threat of an external technology. In the absence of that element, the authors' model may be able to explain a firm's incentives for an innovation rather than incentives for the development of an absorptive capacity. We also identify several internal inconsistencies in the authors' mathematical model. For example, the assumed profit maximization function seems inconsistent with the assumed degree of sophistication of the firm's probability assessment behavior. We believe that the inconsistencies and shortcomings noted here raise serious questions about the validity of the authors' findings. However, we hope that this note does not detract from the pioneering nature of the authors' work, but instead increases its value by stimulating further work on the important topic of absorptive capacity.

Corporate reputations often depend on how reliably promised lead times are met. A goal of filling orders within a service window of T time units is often encountered in practice. This goal ignores the differences among types of units, treating all customers as equally important. Keeping finished goods inventory of all items is only one, and often not the best, way to achieve this objective. High-demand items naturally have safety stock assigned to them, but in many organizations there are so many very-low-demand items that keeping any stock in these items is prohibitively expensive. Customer service can be maintained for these low-demand items by giving them higher production priority when a demand occurs. In this paper, stochastic analysis and simulation are employed to test the merit of this idea. Changes in management structure to allow this type of system are discussed.

J	Chevalier, PB; Wein, LM				Chevalier, PB; Wein, LM			Inspection for circuit board assembly	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality control; inspection decisions; electronics manufacturing	PRODUCTION SYSTEMS	Several stages of tests are typically performed in circuit board assembly, and each test consists of one or more noisy measurements. We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the allocation of inspection and the testing policy in a system with a predefined. inspection configuration; that is, at which stages should a board be inspected, and at these stages, whether to accept or reject a board based on noisy test measurements. The objective is to minimize the expected costs for testing, repair, and defective items shipped to customers. We analyze the problem and document an application of the model to an industrial facility. Since we were unable to gather all the necessary data, the model was applied in a limited and piecemeal fashion. Nevertheless, the proposed policy significantly improves upon the facility's historical policy.

We focus on describing how dynamic statistical process control (DSPC) rules can improve on traditional, static ones. We explore numerical examples and identify nine opportunities for improvement. Some of these ideas are well known and strongly supported in the literature, Other ideas may be less well, understood. Our list includes the following: Cancel some of the inspections called for by an (economically) optimal static rule when starting in control (such as at the beginning of a production run and following a restoration). Inspect more frequently than called for by an optimal static rule once inspections begin, and inspect even more frequently than that when negative evidence is accumulated. Utilize evidence from previous inspections to justify either restoration or another inspection. Cancel inspections and hesitate to restore the process at the end of a production run. Consider using scheduled restoration, in which restoration is carried out regardless of the results of any inspections. implementation, limitations, and extensions are addressed.

J	Kamps, J; Masuch, M				Kamps, J; Masuch, M			Partial deductive closure: Logical simulation and management science	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational ecology; theory-building; logic modeling; automated deduction; artificial intelligence		This research is part of a larger effort to build machine-based tools for developing scientific theories. In analogy with the research process in empirical research, we describe a logical cycle of theory development: (1) starting with an informal version of a theory, (2) then moving to its formal representation, (3) applying formal logic to investigate this representation, and (4) using the results as feedback for the update/revision of the original theory. A central aspect of the logical cycle is the detection of the (hidden) implications of a theory (called ''partial deductive closure''). In this paper, we present an algorithm that performs the partial deductive closure for a relevant class of theorems, while filtering out trivial results. The algorithm is applied to an important organization theory, Organizational Ecology, and is shown to generate new theorems of interest.

J	Sakakibara, S; Flynn, BB; Schroeder, RG; Morris, WT				Sakakibara, S; Flynn, BB; Schroeder, RG; Morris, WT			The impact of just-in-time manufacturing and its infrastructure on manufacturing performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						empirical study; just-in-time manufacturing; manufacturing performance	QUALITY; SYSTEM	We consider Just-in-Time (JIT) to be an overall organizational phenomenon. Accordingly, we developed and tested a model that includes both JIT practices and the infrastructure practices hypothesized to provide an environment in which JIT practices perform more effectively. Canonical correlation analysis was used to test five hypotheses. The results indicated that: (1) there was not a significant relationship between the use of JIT practices, alone, and manufacturing performance; (2) there was a very strong relationship between FT practices and infrastructure practices; (3) the combination of JIT management and infrastructure practice was related to manufacturing performance; (4) infrastructure, by itself, is sufficient to explain manufacturing performance; and (5) manufacturing performance was related to competitive advantage. These findings provide support for the notion that JIT is an overall organizational phenomenon, rather than limited to strictly shop floor practices, and that at least part of its effect on manufacturing performance may bet through providing a set of improvement targets and discipline for the entire organization. in addition, the analysis highlights the areas of infrastructure practice most relevant for future research.

J	Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR				Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR			Does implementing an effective TQM program actually improve operating performance? Empirical evidence from firms that have won quality awards	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						total quality management; quality awards; operating income; sales; costs; financial performance	MANAGEMENT	This study explores the hypotheses that implementing effective total quality management (TQM) programs improves the operating performance of firms. The winning of quality awards is used as a proxy for the effective implementation of TQM programs. Changes in various performance measures for a test sample of quality-award winners are compared against a sample of control firms. Our statistical tests provide strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards outperform the control firms on operating income-based measures Over a 10-year period, from 6 years before to 3 years after the year of winning the first quality award, the mean (median) change in the operating income for the test sample is 107% (48%) higher than that of the control sample. There is reasonably strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards do better on sales growth than the control firms. Over the 10-year period, the mean (median) Change in sales for the test sample is 64% (24%) higher than that of the control sample. We also find weak evidence that firms in our test sample are more successful in controlling costs when compared with the firms in the control sample. in addition, the results indicate that firms in our test sample increased their capital expenditures more than the control sample over the time period prior to winning quality awards. Compared with the control sample, the test sample shows higher growth in both employment and total assets.

J	Gerwin, D; Moffat, L				Gerwin, D; Moffat, L			Withdrawal of team autonomy during concurrent engineering	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						autonomy; cross-functional teams; concurrent engineering; empowerment; new product development	PERFORMANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; MATRIX	Team autonomy is an essential characteristic of cross-functional teams engaged in concurrent engineering. At the same time it is a characteristic that North American firms have considerable difficulty in successfully implementing. Delegating a good deal of decision making to teams is often counteracted by processes that during a new product program withdraw some of a team's autonomy or discretion. Data from 53 cross-functional product development teams in 14 firms indicated that withdrawing autonomy is negatively correlated with both task and process aspects of team performance. The determinants of withdrawing discretion include lack of a shared understanding of the development process, environmental change, and lack of managerial ''buy-in'' to team autonomy. Consequently, successful implementation of team autonomy, through mitigating withdrawal of discretion, requires a clear well-communicated model of the development process, a freezing of design revisions, and policies that encourage managers to support the team rather than interfere in its decision making.

J	Chien, C; Goldsman, D; Melamed, B				Chien, C; Goldsman, D; Melamed, B			Large-sample results for batch means	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; stationary process; variance estimation; batch means estimator	SIMULATION OUTPUT; VARIANCE	In analyzing the output process generated by a steady-state simulation, we often seek to estimate the expected value of the output. The sample mean based on a finite sample of size n is usually the estimator of choice for the steady-state mean; and a measure of the sample mean's precision is the variance parameter, i.e., the limiting value of the sample size multiplied by the variance of the sample mean as n becomes large. This paper establishes asymptotic properties of the conventional batch-means (BM) estimator of the variance parameter as both the batch size and the number of batches become large, In particular, we show that the BM variance estimator is asymtotically unbiased and convergent in mean square. We also provide asymptotic expressions for the variance of the BM variance estimator. Exact and empirical examples illustrate our findings.

These parameters are estimates, and they are usually inaccurate. In this paper, we analyze a type of ''pull'' rule called a proportional restoration rule. We show that these rules are stable; they do not lead to erratic behavior even when the estimation error is significant. We also show that these rules localize the effect of mis-estimates; e.g., underestimating the demand rate lowers the level of finished goods inventory, but has scant effect-within the line. We show that these rules exhibit other desirable attributes-that they are efficient, that they are easy to interpret, and that they recover from disruptions quickly.

J	Gaimon, C				Gaimon, C			Planning information technology-knowledge worker systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information technology; workforce planning; learning curves; IT implementation	OPTIMAL ACQUISITION; PROGRAM COSTS; AUTOMATION; SOFTWARE; HARDWARE; SUBJECT; MODELS; OUTPUT	A model is introduced to examine the long-term planning associated with the purchase and implementation of information technologies (IT) that indirectly contribute to output through enhancement of an organization's knowledge workers. For example, architectural firms in the service industry and manufacturers developing new or modified products invest in computer-aided design systems (CAD) to increase the volume of output generated by the engineering specialist. A critical element of the IT-knowledge worker model introduced is the inclusion of implementation-related dynamics. In particular we model bath the short-term disruption to output that typically occurs at the start of the implementation period and the effect of worker learning during implementation The ability of the organization to generate output is examined in relation to the levels of workforce, information technology, worker skill, and a variety of features of the IT. Seven production function attributes are introduced to quantify the manner in which output is generated for the IT-knowledge worker system. The production function is embedded into an optimization model in which profit is maximized. The formulation is dynamic in order to capture important elements of the decision-making environment, including the learning process, technological change, increasing wages, and changes in the labor supply. Optimal policies are obtained depicting the manner in which an organization should hire and fire its workforce and acquire information technology over time. A fundamental result is obtained establishing the existence of a complementary relationship between IT and knowledge workers. It is shown that a greater level of effective IT increases the desirability of hiring additional workers. In addition, as the ability of the IT to enhance knowledge worker productivity improves (reflecting IT features such as ease of use, functionality, connectivity, etc.), the desirability of hiring additional workers increases. Similarly, due to a high volume of workforce or a high level of worker skill, the desirability of acquiring IT increases. It is also shown that if an organization ignores the nature of the lagged effect of workforce learning, or if the impact of workforce learning on output is underestimated, then the projected volume of output over time is largely exaggerated. These results have important implications to management decision making with respect to effective implementation practices, technology choice issues, and workforce selection. Numerical results are generated to explore the effect of organizational size. It is shown that a smaller organization (as measured by the size of its workforce) relies more heavily on information technology to enhance worker productivity and generate output. Lastly, in response to higher wages, analytic results are derived demonstrating that an organization should reduce its level of hiring and its purchase of IT. Furthermore, numerical results show that an organization paying higher wages should allocate a. greater amount of IT per worker to enhance productivity.

The method assumes an unknown pseudoconcave preference structure of a decision maker throughout the decision process, and the decision maker's ability to select a preferred solution from p + 1 alternatives, where p is the number of objectives. In addition to presenting the supporting theory and algorithm, we perform a comparative study using a fictitious decision maker, comparing our approach to those of Steuer and Choo (1983) and Reeves and Franz (1985). All three methods are interactive. During an iteration, each method presents several solution alternatives to the decision maker simultaneously. Our approach utilizes a Tchebycheff function that facilitates attainment of an optimum at a nonextreme point solution. The statistics collected in the comparative study provide insights into the nature of the algorithms and the behavior of the solution techniques with different categories of problem structure and different underlying utility functions.

J	Federgruen, A; vanRyzin, G				Federgruen, A; vanRyzin, G			Probabilistic analysis of a combined aggregation and math programming heuristic for a general class of vehicle routing and scheduling problems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						vehicle routing; linear programming; probabilistic analysis; polynomial time algorithms; heuristics	COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	We propose and analyze a heuristic that uses region partitioning and an aggregation scheme for customer attributes (load size, time windows, etc.) to create a finite number of customer types. A math program is solved based on these aggregated customer types to generate a feasible solution to the original problem. The problem class we address is quite general and defined by a number of general consistency properties. Problems in this class include VRPs with general distance norms, capacitated problems, time window VRPs, pick-up and delivery problems, combined inventory control and routing problems and are routing. We provide a probabilistic analysis of this heuristic under very general probabilistic assumptions. In particular, we do not require independence between customer locations and their various attributes. The heuristic is (a.s.) epsilon-optimal as the number of customers n tends to infinity. Further, it runs in O(n log n) time for a fixed relative error, and can be designed to be asymptotically optimal while still running in polynomial time. We characterize the asymptotic average value of the heuristic and the optimal solution as the limit of a sequence of linear program values. We also provide bounds on the rate of convergence to the asymptotic value and bounds on tail probabilities. Finally, we discuss numerical issues involved in implementing our heuristic.

J	Upton, DM				Upton, DM			Process range in manufacturing: An empirical study of flexibility	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						manufacturing flexibility; operations strategy; manufacturing improvement; computer-integrated manufacturing; plant management; workforce experience; flexible manufacturing systems		This paper examines the relationship between one form of manufacturing flexibility-process range-and structure, infrastructure, and managerial policy at the plant level. The paper provides evidence of the strength of the links between manufacturing flexibility and such factors as scale, technology vintage, computer integration, and workforce management. Data from 54 plants in the fine-paper industry are presented, and a model of the determinants of short-term flexibility is developed. The plants examined differed by a factor of 20 in their ability to accommodate large process variation. The evidence suggests that flexibility is strongly negatively related to scale and degree of computer integration, yet positively related to newer vintages of mechanical technology and workforce experience. Some results differ significantly from the prevailing view of the industry, in particular, that newer plants are less flexible. The paper shows that newer machine technology is more flexible once other factors are controlled for. In the longer term, the results show that management has a significant impact on the improvement of flexibility in operations, regardless of the technology and infrastructure in place. Plant network managers' views of flexibility are important. The data suggest that inflexible plants may be inflexible partly as a result of their being considered inflexible by network managers, and never being assigned the product range needed to improve the capability.

J	Ha, AY				Ha, AY			Inventory rationing in a make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; inventory rationing; dynamic programming optimal control; applications	COMPONENT COMMONALITY; SAFETY STOCK; MODEL	This paper considers the stock rationing problem of a single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. For the case of Poisson demands and exponential production times, we show that the optimal policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone stock rationing levels. For each demand class, there exists a stock rationing level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher priority demands. A simple queueing model is analyzed to compute the operating cost of a rationing policy. In a numerical study, we compare the optimal rationing policy with a first-come first-served policy to investigate the benefit of stock rationing under different operating conditions of the system.

J	Smith, RP; Eppinger, SD				Smith, RP; Eppinger, SD			A predictive model of sequential iteration in engineering design	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; product development time; engineering design; management of engineering design; design iteration	MANAGEMENT; PROJECT	This paper presents a model describing sequential iteration, one of the fundamental solution processes experienced in complex engineering design projects. The model is based upon the design structure matrix representation and assumes that each individual design activity is of deterministic duration with probabilistic repetition, where the repeat probabilities are defined by the strength of the task coupling. Using the model, we are able to compute rite expected duration of the iterative solution process, and to suggest an initial ordering of the coupled design tasks to minimize the expected duration. We conclude the paper with a discussion of limitations and several extensions to the sequential iteration model.

J	Munoz, DF; Glynn, PW				Munoz, DF; Glynn, PW			A batch means methodology for estimation of a nonlinear function of a steady-state mean	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation output analysis; steady-state simulation; nonlinear estimation; batch means; jackknifing	JACKKNIFE; VARIANCE	We study the estimation of steady-state performance measures from an R-d-valued stochastic process Y = {Y(t) : t greater than or equal to 0} representing the output of a simulation. In many applications, we may be interested in the estimation of a steady-state performance measure that cannot be expressed as a steady-state mean r, e.g., the variance of the steady-state distribution, the ratio of steady-state means, and steady-state conditional expectations. These examples are particular cases of a more general problem-the estimation of a (nonlinear) function f(r) of r. We propose a batch-means-based methodology that allows us to use jackknifing to reduce the bias of the point estimator. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals for f(r) are obtained by combining three different point estimators (classical, batch means, and jackknife) with two different variability estimators (classical and jackknife). The performances of the point estimators are discussed by considering asymptotic expansions for their biases and mean squared errors. Our results show that, if the run length is large enough, the jackknife point estimator provides the smallest bias, with no significant increase in the mean squared error.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						creativity enhancement; problem-solving; decision support; DSS design	ADJECTIVE CHECK LIST; COMPUTER; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; DSS	This paper reports the results of a controlled laboratory experiment in which the work of Elam and Mead (1990) was both replicated and extended to explore how knowledge and use of a creativity-enhancing process employed both manually and delivered via computer software affect the level of creativity in response to a problem-solving ask. The results suggest the enhancement of creativity in response to open-ended problems is significantly affected by the process employed by the decision maker rather than the vehicle by which the process is delivered. Further, the results indicate that the capability of a decision support system (DSS) to provide directed guidance in the application of a process combined with user knowledge of the underlying process model improves creativity enhancement over use of either the DSS or the process alone.

J	Rangaswamy, A; Shell, GR				Rangaswamy, A; Shell, GR			Using computers to realize joint gains in negotiations: Toward an ''electronic bargaining table''	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						negotiation; decision support system; pareto efficiency; conjoint analysis	COMMUNICATION	Multiissue negotiations present opportunities for tradeoffs that create gains for one or more parties without causing any party to be worse off. The literature suggests that parties are often unable to identify and capitalize on such trades. We present a Negotiation Support System, called NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT, that enables negotiators to analyze their own preferences and provides a structured negotiation process to help parties move toward optimal trades. The underlying model is based on a multiattribute representation of preferences and communications over a computer network where offers and counteroffers are evaluated according to one's own preferences. The parties can send and receive both formal offers and informal messages. If and when agreement is reached, the computer evaluates the agreement and suggests improvements based on the criteria of Pareto-superiority. In this paper, we motivate the system, present its analytical foundations, discuss its design and development, and provide an experimental assessment of its ''value-in-use.'' Our results strongly suggest that parties using the system in structured negotiation settings would achieve better outcomes than parties negotiating face to face or over an e-mail messaging facility, other things being equal. For example, only 4 of the 34 dyads (11.1%) negotiating a simulated sales transaction face to face or over e-mail reached an ''integrative'' settlement, as compared with 29 of the 68 dyads (42.6%) using NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT. Systems such as NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT have the potential to be used in emerging ''electronic markets.''

J	Gavish, B; Kalvenes, J				Gavish, B; Kalvenes, J			LEOS - Optimal satellite launch policies: The static case	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						LEOS; telecommunications; satellite launching; dynamic programming	EARTH	Low earth orbit satellite (LEOS) systems promise to provide global communication. A LEOS system consists of a large number of satellites in low orbits. A satellite has a limited Life of approximately five to eight years. Therefore, frequent satellite replenishments are required, and the LEOS systems will be facing annual replenishment costs in the range of several hundred million dollars. This paper considers static satellite launch policies for LEGS systems. The satellite launch problem is formulated and a solution method based on dynamic programming is proposed Lexicographic ordering is used to reduce the search space of the dynamic program to a moderate size. An algorithm for calculating optimal static policies is used to demonstrate the potentially significant economic impact of satellite launch policies on system maintenance costs.

One way to guard against default is prudent margin setting practices designed to protect futures positions from extreme price movements. The objective of this research is to extrapolate the probabilities of encountering extreme price movements by applying statistical extreme value theory to the Finnish stock index futures market. The extreme value technique is found to be appropriate since it generates theoretical margin violation probabilities that closely follow the empirical probability distribution. The extrapolated results provide decision makers information on extreme events that have not yet occurred.

Stochasticities are addressed via a set of discrete scenarios. This paper presents applications in which the traditional stochastic linear program fails to identify a robust solution-despite the presence of a cheap robust point. Limitations of piecewise linearization are discussed. We argue that a concave utility function should be incorporated in a model whenever the decision maker is risk averse. Examples are taken from telecommunications and financial planning.

J	Eisenstein, DD; Iyer, AV				Eisenstein, DD; Iyer, AV			Garbage collection in Chicago: A dynamic scheduling model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						garbage collection; Markov decision process; public sector application; capacitated truck routing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE	We investigate the scheduling of garbage trucks in the city of Chicago, Analysis of data collected from the system shows that city blocks differ in the rate at which garbage is collected. However, in the current system, each truck visits the dumpsite two times each day. Our approach is to devise a flexible routing scheme in which some routes visit the dumpsite only once per day, while others visit the dumpsite twice per day depending on the blocks assigned to the route. We use a Markov decision process to model the impact on capacity of using flexible routes, This provides a dynamic scheduling algorithm that adjusts the number of dumpsite visits throughout the week to maximize service level. Results of the model suggest a potential reduction in truck capacity of 12-16% for a set of five pilot wards. This paper shows that flexible schedules can significantly reduce the capacity required to operate a system in the presence of variability.

J	Levinthal, DA				Levinthal, DA			Adaptation on rugged landscapes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational adaptation; organizational forms; environmental selection	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS	A simple model is developed to explore the interrelationship between processes of organizational level change and population selection forces. A critical property of the model is that the effect on organizational fitness of the various attributes that constitute an organization's form is interactive. As a result of these interaction effects, the fitness landscape is ''rugged.'' An organization's form at founding has a persistent effect on its future form when there are multiple peaks in the fitness landscape, since the particular peak that an organization discovers is influenced by its starting position in the space of alternative organizational forms. Selection pressures influence the distribution of the organizational forms that emerge from the process of local adaptation. The ability of established organizations to respond to changing environments is importantly conditioned by the extent to which elements of organizational form interact in their effect on organizational fitness. Tightly coupled organizations are subject to high rates of failure in changing environments. Furthermore, successful ''reorientations'' are strongly associated with survival for tightly coupled organizations, but not for more loosely coupled organizations that are able to engage in effective local adaptation.

J	Platt, DE; Robinson, LW; Freund, RB				Platt, DE; Robinson, LW; Freund, RB			Tractable (Q,R) heuristic models for constrained service levels	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/production; approximations; stochastic models; service level	STOCHASTIC INVENTORY SYSTEMS; POWER APPROXIMATION; POLICIES	The fill rate (the proportion of demand that is satisfied from stock) is a viable alternative in inventory models to the hard-to-quantify penalty cost. However, a number of difficulties have impeded its implementation, among them that the existing cycle-based approximate solutions do not reflect the possibility of multiple outstanding orders and that the optimal policy cannot be found directly, but must be iteratively calculated. We show that for a large family of leadtime demand distributions, the optimal policy depends on only two parameters: the fill rate and the economic order quantity (EOQ) scaled by the standard deviation of demand over the constant leadtime. If we then assume that the leadtime demand is normally distributed, we can use the asymptotic results as the EOQ goes to zero and to positive infinity to fit atheoretic curves for the order quantity Q and the reorder point R. These fitted curves yield a good (Q, R) policy without iteration. We also find that, among the set of simple heuristics, the limit form as EOQ goes to positive infinity provides a better alternative to simply setting Q equal to the EOQ.

J	Eliashberg, J; Singpurwalla, ND; Wilson, SP				Eliashberg, J; Singpurwalla, ND; Wilson, SP			Calculating the reserve for a time and usage indexed warranty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision analysis; failure rate; logistic function; proportional hazard; reliability theory; utility; warranty reserve	PRODUCT WARRANTY; SURVIVAL; MODELS	Many products carry a warranty that offers protection for the consumer against low quality. warranties are often two dimensional, such as an automobile warranty that guarantees repair up to a certain time and mileage after sale. This paper considers the problem of assessing the size of a reserve needed by the manufacturer to meet future claims for such a two-dimensional warranty. To do this, a class of failure models that describe failure by two scales-time and mileage, for example-must be developed. The first half of the paper is devoted to this development. Then the warranty reserve problem is considered in more detail. The problem is described and a decision-theoretic solution, making use of the newly developed reliability model, is proposed.

J	Carley, KM; Lin, ZA				Carley, KM; Lin, ZA			A theoretical study of organizational performance under information distortion	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; organizations; performance; stress	NETWORKS; MODEL	How should organizations of intelligent agents be designed so that they exhibit high performance despite information distortion? We present a formal information-based network model of organizational performance given a distributed decision making environment in which agents encounter a radar detection task. Using this model, we examine rite performance of organizations with, various designs in different task environments subject to various types of information distortion, We distinguish five sources of information distortion-missing information, incorrect information, agent unavailability, communication channel breakdowns, and agent turnover. This formal analysis suggests that: (1) regardless of information, distortion, performance is enhanced if there is a match between the complexity of organizational design and task environment; (2) task environment characteristics have more effect on performance than information distortion and the organizational design; (3) the effects of information distortion can be combated by training, but only to a limited extent; and (4) technology based information distortion typically is more debilitating than personnel induced information distortion.

A Bayesian approach to dynamic seemingly unrelated regression (DSUR) is a robust and effective means to forecast the one-step ahead, conditional distribution of asset returns. This approach recognizes the time-varying nature of the global capital markets. The predictive moments are used to derive a single-factor return model once an index portfolio is specified. The index portfolio represents an investor's underlying portfolio. Given the factor model that assesses the relative attractiveness and risk of the assets in relation to the index, an index neutral portfolio is constructed as an overlay to enhance the returns of the index portfolio. This portfolio is mean-variance optimal, is notional neutral (i.e., the sum of the asset exposures is zero), and has returns that are designed to be uncorrelated with the returns of the index portfolio. The implementation of such an index neutral portfolio using derivative securities is simulated over the period January 1988 to December 1993.

J	Gong, LG; Jwo, WS; Tang, K				Gong, LG; Jwo, WS; Tang, K			Using on-line sensors in statistical process control	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						statistical process control; on-line sensor; economic models	VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVALS; CONTROL CHARTS; ECONOMIC DESIGN	As manufacturing technology moves toward more computerized automation, statistical process control (SPC) techniques must adapt to keep pace with the new environment and take advantage of the development in automated on-line sensors. In this paper, a two-phase procedure is proposed for combining an on-line sensor and a control chart to improve statistical process control decisions. In phase 1 of this procedure, a production process is monitored continually by a sensor. When a sensor warning signal is observed, phase 2 takes place: A sample of items is drawn from the process and inspected. If the sample mean is outside the predetermined control limits, the process is stopped, and a search is initiated to determine the actual process status for possible necessary adjustment. If the sample mean is within the control limits, the process continues. A mathematical model is formulated for jointly determining the sample size and the control limit of the control chart and a decision rule for sending out sensor warning signals. The model is based on the assumption that there is only a weak relationship between the sensor measurement and the process condition. A solution algorithm based on a numerical search is developed. A numerical example is used to show the advantage of the proposed model over the models based separately on the sensor and the control chart, and a sensitivity analysis is used to show the effects of several important model parameters on the optimal solution.

J	Connolly, T; Dean, D				Connolly, T; Dean, D			Decomposed versus holistic estimates of effort required for software writing tasks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software estimating; decomposition; calibration; overconfidence; interval estimation; overoptimism; aggregation	SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS; CONTINUOUS-VARIABLES; JUDGMENTS; HINDSIGHT; KNOWLEDGE; EVENTS; RISK	We examine decision analysis' central ''decomposition principle'' in the context of work-time estimates of software writers. Two experiments examined the abilities of advanced programming students to estimate how long they would take to complete specific software projects. They estimated their own work times both for entire projects and for their constituent subtasks. Estimates showed varying degrees of overoptimism and overpessimism but all were much too tight, with almost half of actual outcomes falling in the 1% tails of estimated distributions. This overtightness was unaffected by task decomposition, question wording, question order, or training in estimation. It was, however, significantly reduced by a procedure aimed at inducing generous upper and lower plausible limits. An underlying model of incomplete search is used to connect these findings to existing themes in cognition and judgment research, as well as to practical application. The findings suggest that the best level of decomposition at which to elicit work-time estimates may depend on task, judge, and elicitation method.

J	Zhang, GC				Zhang, GC			Moral hazard in corporate investment and the disciplinary role of voluntary capital rationing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capital rationing; principal-agent; high hurdle rate; NPV; renegotiation-proof	INCENTIVE CONTRACTS; PRINCIPAL; PROJECTS	This paper compares three capital-budgeting rules, the NPV rule, a high hurdle rate and capital rationing, and explains why some firms may voluntarily impose capital rationing. Under both capital rationing and a high hurdle, a restrictive investment criterion is used to control managerial shirking. However, implementation of these budgeting rules requires a mechanism to prevent the firm from expanding the investment scale ex post. Capital rationing, in the form of a predetermined, fixed budget, differs from the high-hurdle-rate rule in that the former requires the firm to overcome the cost of raising additional capital before making further investment.

We analyze the tradeoff between the increase in the potential value of products gained by putting off the ''mating'' of components exhibiting various characteristic ''types,'' and the inventory costs caused by this delay in mating. We formulate this dynamic type mating problem as a Markov Decision Process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy for special cases. We then present a heuristic policy for a more general case and compare its performance against the optimal policy. Computational results indicate that the heuristic is effective for a wide variety of cases.		Duenyas, I (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT IND & OPERAT ENGN,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.

J	Sridhar, S; Balachandran, BV				Sridhar, S; Balachandran, BV			Incomplete information, task assignment, and managerial control systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						boundaries of firm; incomplete information; internal employee versus outside supplier; assignment of tasks; outsourcing; control system	PRINCIPAL	A firm typically assigns multiple tasks it must perform to either internal employees or outside vendors. This paper demonstrates the need to integrate a task assignment decision with the design of a managerial control system as each affects the other. An internal employee is distinguished from an outside supplier on four different informational dimensions: (i) at the time of contracting, the outside supplier has less information about the task environment more often than the internal employee; (ii) the principal observes the employee's information set more frequently than that of the supplier; (iii) the principal can exercise a greater control over information flow to the internal employee than to the outside supplier; and (iv) the principal may share the details of the outside supplier's contract with the internal employee but not vice versa. Under each of these lour distinguishing dimensions, the principal is shown to outsource the upstream task and assign the downstream task to the internal employee more often than vice versa. Further, under the last two dimensions of the firm's boundary, the principal can eliminate inefficiencies arising from the agents' contracting with incomplete information by assigning the downstream task to the employee and not providing predecision information to him while assigning the upstream task to the supplier.

J	Sueyoshi, T				Sueyoshi, T			Measuring efficiencies and returns to scale of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone in production and cost analyses	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						telecommunications; Data Envelopment Analysis; returns to scale; scale economies; cost analysis	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; DEA; INEFFICIENCIES; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	This article provides a theoretical framework related to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in which an analytical relationship among eight different efficiency concepts is defined and explored in terms of production and cost analyses. This article extends the theoretical basis into the measurement of Scale Economies (SE) and Returns to Scale (RTS). A unique feature of the SE/RTS measurement is that the proposed approach is based upon the measurement regarding not only production activity but also cost performance. As an important case study, this article applies the DEA-based approach to measure the eight efficiency concepts and SE/RTS of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT). This study finds that NTT has maintained high SE and increasing RTS in the operations of 39 annual periods from 1953 through 1992.

J	Hunton, JE; Price, KH				Hunton, JE; Price, KH			Effects of the user participation process and task meaningfulness on key information system outcomes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information systems; user involvement; user participation; procedural justice	PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; GOAL ACCEPTANCE; PERFORMANCE; SATISFACTION; INVOLVEMENT; JUDGMENTS; FAIRNESS; DESIGN; VOICE	In this study, 144 professional accounting data entry clerks took part in a fully randomized field experiment using a 4 (mode of participation) X 2 (task meaningfulness) design. Participants were full-time, mandatory users of payroll applications. The nature of the experiment engaged these users in hands-on activity (Hartwick and Barki 1994) regarding the development of a payroll input screen. User mode of participation was manipulated by varying the extent of decision input used to execute hands-on activity in accordance with procedural justice theory. Perceptions of decision control, procedural justice, and outcome satisfaction, as well as objective levels of task performance escalated with corresponding increases in decision input. Task meaningfulness was manipulated by creating either high or low expectations of using the payroll input screen in the near future. As the development task became more meaningful, procedural justice, decision control, task commitment, and task performance responses also increased. An underlying theoretical model of treatment effects was tested using path analysis which supported the control-oriented theory of procedural justice. The strong attitudinal and behavioral results observed in this experiment enhance understanding of the user participation and involvement model proposed by Hartwick and Barki (1994) by incorporating process considerations from procedural justice theory into their framework. Implications of this research are discussed.	UNIV TEXAS, DEPT MANAGEMENT, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA	Hunton, JE (reprint author), UNIV S FLORIDA, SCH ACCOUNTANCY, TAMPA, FL 33620 USA.

We analyze both matching and choice behavior. We find that violations of the stationarity axiom are restricted to matching behavior, both for certainty and risk. We also compare the discounting of certain and risky outcomes as well as the discounting of gains and losses. In matching tasks, certain outcomes are discounted more than risky ones. We could not confirm these results in a choice task. Gains and losses are not found to be discounted at different rates.

J	Gopalakrishnan, M; Ahire, SL; Miller, DM				Gopalakrishnan, M; Ahire, SL; Miller, DM			Maximizing the effectiveness of a preventive maintenance system: An adaptive modeling approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						preventive maintenance; multi-logit regression; binary integer programming	DECISION; SUBJECT; DEMAND	The dynamic nature of an operating environment, such as machine utilization and breakdown frequency results in changing preventive maintenance (PM) needs for manufacturing equipment. In this paper, we present an approach to generate an adaptive PM schedule which maximizes the net savings from PM subject to workforce constraints. The approach consists of two components: (a) task prioritization based on a multi-legit regression model for each type of PM task, and (b) task rescheduling based on a binary integer programming (BIP) model with constraints on single-skilled and multi-skilled workforce availability. The task prioritization component develops a multi-legit regression for machine failure probability associated with each type of PM task at the beginning of the year, using historical data on machine utilization, PM, and machine breakdowns. At the start of each PM time-bucket (e.g., a month), we use the updated machine failure probability for each candidate PM task to compute its current contribution to net PM savings, which indicates its current priority. The task rescheduling BIP model incorporates the priorities in selecting tasks for the current bucket to maximize PM effectiveness subject to workforce availability, yielding an adaptive and effective PM schedule for each time-bucket of the master PM schedule. We examine the effect of using multi-skilled workforce on the overall PM effectiveness, and also provide an illustration from a newspaper publishing environment to explain the use of the approach. We have developed four heuristic algorithms to yield good solutions to large scale versions of this scheduling problem. The heuristics perform extremely well, and the best heuristic solution is within 1.4% of optimality on an average.

It consists of determining daily schedules which maximize the anticipated profits derived from the aircraft of a heterogeneous fleet. This fleet must cover a set of operational flight legs with known departure time windows, durations and profits according to the aircraft type. We present two models for this problem: a Set Partitioning type formulation and a time constrained multicommodity network flow formulation. We describe the network structure of the subproblem when a column generation technique is applied to solve the linear relaxation of the first model and when a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach is used to solve the linear relaxation of the second model. The linear relaxation of the first model provides upper bounds. Integer solutions to the overall problem are derived through branch-and-bound. By exploiting the equivalence between the two formulations, we propose various optimal branching strategies compatible with the column generation technique. Finally we report computational results obtained an data provided by two different airlines. These results show that significant profit improvement can be generated by solving the DARSP using our approach and that this can be obtained in a reasonable amount of CPU time.

The empirical data from small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) that share a common economic and industrial environment show that CEOs' perceptions of external environment-and riot objective measures-are key significant issues with respect to technology policy formulation and enactment in SMEs and its subsequent organizational impacts. In particular, perceived environmental hostility and dynamism are shown to have specific and differing moderating roles on the form and strength of the relationships between technology policy and its determinants and between technology policy and realized innovative efforts, Furthermore, a more aggressive technology policy leads to greater realized innovative efforts, which in turn are positively related to export performance and, to a lesser extent, to financial performance.

J	Guerrero, VM; Elizondo, JA				Guerrero, VM; Elizondo, JA			Forecasting a cumulative variable using its partially accumulated data	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						exponential soothing; linear regression; minimum mean square error; statistical approach	TIME-SERIES	Several forecasting algorithms have been proposed to forecast a cumulative variable using its partially accumulated data. Some particular cases of this problem are known in the literature as the ''style goods inventory problem'' or as ''forecasting shipments using firm orders-to-date'', among other names. Here we summarize some of the most popular techniques and propose a statistical approach to discriminate among them in an objective (data-based) way. Our basic idea is to use statistical models to produce minimum mean square error forecasts and let the data lead us to select an appropriate model to represent their behavior. We apply our proposal to some published data showing total accumulated values with constant level and then to two actual sets of data pertaining to the Mexican economy, showing a nonconstant level. The forecasting performance of the statistical models was evaluated by comparing their results against those obtained with algorithmic solutions. In general the models produced better forecasts for all lead times, as indicated by the most common measures of forecasting accuracy and precision.

We provide an objective function transformation for the model developed by Porteus multi-product (1985) that permits the use of marginal analysis in both the single- and multiple-item problems. For the multiple-item problem, we show that managers should not reduce the setup for each product to its optimum in sequential order. This is in contrast to recommendations found in the existing literature.

J	Kouvelis, P; Gutierrez, GJ				Kouvelis, P; Gutierrez, GJ			The Newsvendor problem in a global market: Optimal centralized and decentralized control policies for a two-market stochastic inventory system	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						supply chain management; international operations management; inventory management	LOCATION	The global markets of today offer to the ''style goods'' producer more selling opportunities and pose new challenges in production planning and coordination. From a production management standpoint the opportunity to exploit the difference in timing of the selling season of geographically dispersed markets for ''style goods'' is important for improving the firm's profitability. In this paper we examine the above issue with an insightful model of a producer of ''style goods'' selling the goods to two markets (a primary and a secondary market) with nonoverlapping selling seasons. We refer to this problem as the ''global newsvendor'' problem. For the above two market stochastic inventory systems we first develop optimal centralized control policies. Then we demonstrate the suboptimality of decentralized production control policies, with the production centers at each market treated as independent profit centers and a constant transfer price being used to coordinate their production. We propose as an effective alternative a decentralized production control structure with a nonlinear pricing scheme for production coordination among centers administered through an intermediate organizational unit. In our modeling, we explicitly consider the effects of exchange rate uncertainty on the production planning decisions.

J	Bowden, RJ				Bowden, RJ			Generalising interest rate duration with directional derivatives: Direction X and applications	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Direction X; directional derivative; duration; fixed interest; portfolio management; term structure	TERM STRUCTURE; EQUILIBRIUM-MODEL; IMMUNIZATION; RISK	Conventional (or Fisher-Weil) duration is an ordinary derivative that measures the response of portfolio value to marginal parallel shifts in the term structure, while other proposed measures are generally specific to particular interest rate processes. In this paper, we show that portfolio responses to arbitrary shifts in the term structure may be handled by the use of Frechet or directional derivatives, presenting a simple algorithm for the directional derivative of a fixed interest portfolio, viewed as a set of cash flows. For a given portfolio, one can locate the most sensitive areas along the term structure by computing a function or profile (''Direction X'') that gives the term structure movement to which the portfolio is most exposed. Immunisation techniques can be based on choosing ancillary assets that ensure that the portfolio directional derivative is zero, or as close to zero as possible; this generalises approaches based on factor models of the term structure, The analysis is applied to both continuous and discrete time.

J	Larkey, P; Kadane, JB; Austin, R; Zamir, S				Larkey, P; Kadane, JB; Austin, R; Zamir, S			Skill in games	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian game theory; game theory; poker; simulation; strategy		Differences in players' skill are important determinants of relative player success in most real games such as poker, chess, basketball, business, and politics. Yet conventional game theory has concentrated primarily on games with no skill differences among players. This paper uses a simplified version of stud poker to better understand the concept of differential player skill in games. Players with very different strategies for playing this game are modeled algorithmically and pitted against one another in simulation tournaments.

J	Ito, K				Ito, K			Domestic competitive position and export strategy of Japanese manufacturing firms: 1971-1985	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						domestic competition; market share; export	UNITED-STATES; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; DIVERSIFICATION; DETERMINANTS	This paper analyzes Japanese manufacturing firms' export behavior and their performance. In a slow growth era, leading firms' and minor firms' export ratio tended to be less than that of follower (medium market share) firms in the same industry; there appears to be an inverted-U shape between export ratio and relative size of firms. An affiliation with a large industrial group has no positive relationship with export ratio, while other firm-specific factors do not show consistent relationships with ie in the years 1971 to 1985. Exports and firm performance do not have a positive relationship. Competitive environment in the domestic market is related to the export strategy of Japanese firms.

When the model base is large and diverse, this task can be quite difficult. Furthermore, the number and variety of models available can be confusing. One way to simplify the user's interaction with the DSS, and facilitate more effective use of the system, is through the use of ''views'' of the model base. A view is an abstraction of a model base that limits attention to relationships between certain variables, and its purpose is to guide the development of DSS software that executes lower-level models in response to higher-level requests for information or analysis. Single views may be of use to individual decision makers who wish to abstract information from a model base, and multiple views may be of use to collections of decision makers who are using a model base to integrate their analyses to make a collective decision. In this paper, we show how representation of models using a graph theoretic structure called a metagraph can facilitate the construction and maintenance of model base views. In particular, we show how useful views can be constructed using a projection operation on a metagraph, and also present conditions under which views can be combined. The concepts developed in the paper are illustrated using an example from life cycle costing.

J	Delquie, P				Delquie, P			''Bi-matching'': A new preference assessment method to reduce compatibility effects	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision analysis; preferences; utility assessment; biases	CHOICE; REVERSAL	Preference models and utility functions are often assessed by eliciting value trade-offs among attributes. Prior research has shown that trade-off judgments can be biased in systematic ways: for example, the attribute which is used as response receives more relative subjective weight, i.e. the so-called scale compatibility effects (Tversky et al. 1988). This paper proposes a new procedure to elicit value trade-offs called bidimensional matching, of ''bi-matching'', designed to alleviate this effect. Bi-matching differs from traditional trade-off judgments in that both attributes are adjusted simultaneously to reach indifference judgments. Bi-matching is compared with simple matching and choice in four experimental studies, to measure preferences for lotteries and riskless multiattribute alternatives. The main results are: (I) bi-matching produces trade-offs intermediate between those derived from matching on the ''more important'' attribute and matching on the less important attribute, although closer to the former; (2) the trade-offs derived from choice reflect more relative weight on the more important dimension than those from bi-matching (3) bi-matching appears to reduce response error compared to standard matching. These results are generally consistent with theoretical predictions. We discuss the normative question of which preference assessment method is preferable. The current results as a whole and the built-in features of the bi-matching procedure already position this elicitation method as a worthwhile alternative to traditional methods for helping decision-makers introspect and construct their value trade-offs.

J	Pinsonneault, A; Kraemer, KL				Pinsonneault, A; Kraemer, KL			Middle management downsizing: An empirical investigation of the impact of information technology	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						middle management; downsizing; IT impact; productivity paradox; centralization; decentralization	ORGANIZATIONS	Nearly all Fortune 1000 firms claim to have downsized since the early eighties, and it is argued that information technology (IT) is responsible for this massive downsizing. However, earlier research has indicated that IT increases middle management. Even though the impact of IT on the middle management workforce has been studied for the last thirty years, research has failed to clearly explain this phenomenon. Quite the opposite, research has fueled controversy and has provided inconsistent findings. This article addresses the state of inconsistent findings across multiple studies by examining the impact of information technology on the number of middle managers using two additional variables: the degree of centralization of organizational decision authority and the degree of centralization of computing decision authority. One hundred and fifty-five city governments were surveyed. Information technology was found to be both positively and negatively associated with the size of the middle management workforce. The impact of information technology was fundamentally determined by who controlled computing decisions and what interests were being served, and by the roles of middle managers. Information technology was associated with a decrease in the size of the middle management workforce in organizations with centralized decision authority and with an increase in the number of middle managers in organizations where decision authority was decentralized.

In a services context (insurance), we examine how two facets of performance, from the point of view of both the principal and the agent, are influenced by the perceiver's belief that it. is more committed to the relationship than is the other party. Using primary data from 255 insurance agent-insurance provider dyads, we show that each side's assessment of how much it benefits from the dyad is related in a potentially dysfunctional manner to its perception of asymmetric commitment. Perceivers rate their performance outcomes from the dyad (i.e., harmony and profit) highest when they believe they are less committed than their counterpart. Conversely, they rate their own performance outcomes lowest when they believe they are more committed than the other party. We explain this finding in terms of suspected opportunism and offer a partial! test of this explanation compared with explanations from theories of equity and power/dependence. Further, we demonstrate that each party's perception of asymmetric commitment partially reflects actual asymmetry, as measured by confidential data collected from both sides. Perceived asymmetric commitment is also shown to be related to levels of communication and dependence in the dyad. Managerial implications for reducing perceived asymmetric commitment and improving the performance outcomes of each dyad member are discussed.

J	Dasu, S; Li, L				Dasu, S; Li, L			Optimal operating policies in the presence of exchange rate variability	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						international operations; exchange rate variability; optimal policies; setup costs; synthetic fiber industry	UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; OPTION; FLEXIBILITY	We study the structure of the optimal policies for a firm operating plants in different countries. The relative costs of production between the plants are assumed to vary over time due to economic and political factors such as exchange rates, inflation, taxes, and tariffs. Based on the costs, the firm can alter the quantity produced in each plant. We determine the structure of the optimal policies for deciding when and by how much to alter the production quantities. When the switch-over costs are linear or step functions, regardless of whether the variable production costs are concave or piece-wise linear convex, and regardless of whether the firm is supplying one or more markets, the optimal policy is always a barrier policy. The optimal barriers can be determined by using linear programming techniques, and the optimal costs can be computed by solving a system of linear equations. When the number of optimal barriers is two, the optimal expected costs and the condition that determines the optimal barriers are explicitly derived.

J	Prasad, SY; Karwan, MH; Zionts, S				Prasad, SY; Karwan, MH; Zionts, S			Use of convex cones in interactive multiple objective decision making	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multiple criteria decision making; interactive procedures; preference representation	PROGRAMMING METHOD; CRITERIA PROBLEM	One approach for solving decision problems involving multiple objectives is interactive optimization. Methods based on this approach assess the decision maker's preference structure interactively, typically based on pairwise comparisons and tradeoffs, and guide the search process toward identifying improved solutions. A desirable feature of such approaches, that is based on minimizing the preference information requirements, is fast convergence. Toward this end, the use of convex cones as a preference structure representation has been proposed in the literature. In this work, new theory is developed that aids in further reducing preference information requirements and improving convergence. New cones termed p cones are developed. The efficiencies of solution alternatives are evaluated with respect to the p cones, and these are termed p cone efficiencies. Acceleration and Early Termination procedures that are based on these efficiencies are proposed. The procedures are presented within a solution framework for solving Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) problems along with computational results.

In doing so, we formalize a notion of ''system complexity'' and investigate its implications for the allocation of these scarce resources. Using detailed data from fieldwork at all mainframe manufacturers in the world to investigate our theoretical predictions, we provide evidence that larger market share firms set more aggressive stage targets, as do more resource-rich firms. Our results can be seen as a verification of the mechanism underlying Arrow's ''replacement'' effect.		Khanna, T (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV,GRAD SCH BUSINESS ADM,BOSTON,MA 02163, USA.

J	Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR				Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR			Delays in new product introductions and the market value of the firm: The consequences of being late to the market	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product delays; event studies; stock market response	DAILY STOCK RETURNS; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; EVENT; TIME	This paper empirically estimates the impact of not meeting promised new product introduction dates on the market value of the firm. We estimate the average ''abnormal'' change in the market value for a sample of 101 firms around the date when information about delaying the introduction of new products is publicly announced. On average, delay announcements decrease the market value of the firm by 5.25%. The average dollar change in the market value in 1991 dollars is $-119.3 million. The evidence suggests that there are significant penalties for not introducing new products on time. To provide further insight, regression analyses are used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in market value. We find that the competitiveness of the industry in which the firm operates, the size of the firm, and the firm's degree of diversification are statistically significant predictors for the change in the market value of firms that announce delays in the introduction of new products.

J	Krishnan, V; Eppinger, SD; Whitney, DE				Krishnan, V; Eppinger, SD; Whitney, DE			A model-based framework to overlap product development activities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; concurrent engineering; overlapping	CONCURRENT DESIGN	Intense competition in many industries forces manufacturing firms to develop new, higher quality products at an increasingly rapid pace. Overlapping product development activities is an important component of concurrent product development that can help firms develop products faster. However, since product development activities may be coupled in complex ways, overlapping interrelated activities can present many difficulties. Without careful management of the overlapped product development process, the development effort and cost may increase, and product quality may worsen. This paper goes beyond the common recommendation to simply overlap activities as much as possible. We present a model-based framework to manage the overlapping of coupled product development activities. The model and framework identify conditions under which various types of overlapping are appropriate for a pair of coupled activities. We illustrate the model and framework with industrial applications involving the development of electronic pagers and automobile doors.

The authors analyze new product development by three international manufacturers that dominate a segment of the electronic component industry. The objective is to examine the impact of two distinct product development strategies and structures on time-to-market. The analysis of more than 200 new product developments provides important findings. A concentrated new product development structure, in contrast to a distributed structure, affords rapid prototyping. However, volume production is reached faster in the distributed structure. Also, devoting more time to prototyping hastens volume production.

J	Burchill, G; Fine, CH				Burchill, G; Fine, CH			Time versus market orientation in product concept development: Empirically-based theory generation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; system dynamics; causal loop modeling; total quality management	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; PERSONNEL; MODELS	In collaboration with industry partners, a normative model of the product concept decision process was developed, supported with tools and techniques, and codified as a decision support process for product development teams. This process (Concept Engineering) was then introduced into a number of product development teams in different companies. A comparative analysis of actual product concept development activities, with and without the use of Concept Engineering, was conducted. All of the observed teams viewed time to market as a critical measure of their success. However, the development processes differed significantly depending on whether relatively more emphasis was placed on time or market considerations. Key variables associated with the product concept development decision process and time-to-market dynamics were identified and a theory of the concept development process was developed using the inductive system diagram technique, a research methodology developed in the course of this work. We believe this work contributes to the operations management literature in three ways. First, it introduces a very detailed, structured decision process for product concept development, enhancing the literature on Quality Function Deployment (QFD). Second, it presents a theory of product concept development that can improve understanding of success and failure in product concept development. Third, this work develops new methodology (Inductive Systems Diagrams) for field work in operations management. This methodology marries the grounded theory methods, familiar to sociologists with causal-loop modeling familiar to systems dynamicists, yielding a rigorous tool for systematically collecting, organizing, and distilling large amounts of field-based data.

J	MacDuffie, JP				MacDuffie, JP			The road to ''root cause'': Shop-floor problem-solving at three auto assembly plants	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						problem-solving; adaptive learning; quality; knowledge; organizational capabilities	QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; STRATEGY; INDUSTRY	This paper uses case studies of shop-floor problem-solving at three automotive assembly plants to examine organizational influences on process quality improvement. Three complex quality problems-water leaks, paint defects, and electrical defects-were chosen because they are universally found in assembly plants, have multiple sources, and can only be resolved with high levels of interaction and coordination among individuals in multiple departments or functional groups. The case studies focus particularly on the early stages of the problem-solving process-problem definition, problem analysis, and the generation of solutions-emphasizing how each plant tries to identify the ''root cause'' of defects. The paper then explores consistencies and contrasts within and across the three cases to analyze the factors underlying effective shop-floor problem-solving. Central to this analysis is the idea that successful process quality improvement depends heavily on how the organization influences the cognitive processes of its members. Problem-solving processes benefit from rich data that capture multiple perspectives on a problem; problem categories that are ''fuzzy''; and organizational structures that facilitate the development of a common language for discussing problems. Also, when problems are framed as opportunities for learning, the combination of positive attributions that boost motivation and the suppression of threat effects can improve the effectiveness of improvement activities. Finally, when process standardization is understood as marking the beginning (and not the end) of further improvement efforts, the normal inertial tendencies of organizations with respect to adaptive learning can be partially overcome.

J	Sterman, JD; Repenning, NP; Kofman, F				Sterman, JD; Repenning, NP; Kofman, F			Unanticipated side effects of successful quality programs: Exploring a paradox of organizational improvement	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational behavior; quality; simulation; system dynamics; TQM	SIMULATION-MODELS	Recent evidence suggests the connection between quality improvement and financial results may be weak. Consider the case of Analog Devices, Inc., a leading manufacturer of integrated circuits. Analog's TQM program was a dramatic success. Yield doubled, cycle time was cut in half, and product defects fell by a factor of ten. However, financial performance worsened. To explore the apparent paradox we develop a detailed simulation model of Analog, including operations, financial and cost accounting, product development, human resources, the competitive environment, and the financial markets. We used econometric estimation, interviews, observation, and archival data to specify and estimate the model. We find that improvement programs like TQM can present firms with a tradeoff between short and long run effects. In the long run TQM can increase productivity, raise quality, and lower costs. In the short run, these improvements can interact with prevailing accounting systems and organizational routines to create excess capacity, financial stress, and pressure for layoffs that undercut commitment to continuous improvement. We explore policies to promote sustained improvement in financial as well as nonfinancial measures of performance.

J	Ittner, CD; Larcker, DF				Ittner, CD; Larcker, DF			The performance effects of process management techniques	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process improvement; quality management; value chain; competitive advantage; organizational design		This paper provides exploratory evidence on the cross-sectional association between process management techniques and two profit measures: return on assets and return on sales. Using a sample of firms in two industries (automotive and computer) and four countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States), we find that certain process management techniques improve profitability while others have little effect on financial performance; In particular, long-term partnerships with suppliers and customers are associated with higher performance in both industries. The value of other techniques such as statistical process control, process capability studies, and cycle time analysis, on the other hand, appears to vary by industry, reflecting differences in the stages of the two industries' process management practices. Finally, computer organizations following an innovation-oriented strategy earned significantly higher accounting returns regardless of the process management techniques employed, suggesting that these techniques have only a second-order effect on performance in this industry.

J	Cohen, MA; Whang, SJ				Cohen, MA; Whang, SJ			Competing in product and service: A product life-cycle model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						logistics; service management; after-sales service; multiechelon inventory	PRICE-COMPETITION	In this paper we develop a product life-cycle model that studies a set of strategic choices facing manufacturers as they design the joint product/service bundle for a product which may require maintenance and repair support after its sale. The choice parameters of interest include the product price, the quality of after-sales service and the price to be charged for the after-sales service. We adopt a competitive, game-theoretic (as opposed to single-firm optimization) framework, where there is competition for the provision of after-sales service between the manufacturer and an independent service operator. The product price and the service quality/price are characterized by an equilibrium to a sequential game. The resulting outcome is applied to support the valuation of alternative product designs in explicit consideration of the tradeoff between profit from product sale and from the provision of after-sales service. The model can also be used to evaluate the asset value of a firm's customer base.

In this setting, inbound orders from a downstream member serve as a valuable informational input to upstream production and inventory decisions. This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of ''orders'' tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and the distortion tends to increase as one moves upstream-a phenomenon termed ''bullwhip effect.'' This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations. Actions that can be taken to mitigate the detrimental impact of this distortion are also discussed.

Under QR, the retailer has the ability to adjust orders based on better demand information. We study how a manufacturer-retailer channel impacts choices of production and marketing variables under QR in the apparel industry. Specifically, we build formal models of the inventory decisions of manufacturers and retailers both before and after QR. Our models allow us to address who wins and who loses under QR and suggest actions such as service level, wholesale price and volume commitments that can be used to make QR profitable for both members of the channel, i.e., Pareto improving. Detailed discussions with a major retailer, and information from industry sources provide supporting evidence for the structure and conclusions of the model.

The approach is illustrated using scanner tracking data of brand actions in a real market. An asymmetric market-share model and a category-volume model are combined to represent market response to the actions of brand managers. The actions available to each artificial brand manager are constrained to four typical marketing actions of each from the historical data. Each brand's strategies evolve through simulations of repeated interactions in a virtual market, using the estimated weekly profits of each brand as measures of its fitness for the genetic algorithm. The artificial agents bred in this environment outperform the historical actions of brand managers in the real market. The implications of these findings for the study of marketing strategy are discussed.

J	Smith, RP; Eppinger, SD				Smith, RP; Eppinger, SD			Identifying controlling features of engineering design iteration	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product development; engineering design; design iteration; design process modeling; product development lead time	INNOVATION	Engineering design often involves a very complex set of relationships among a large number of coupled problems. It is this complex coupling that leads to iteration among the various engineering tasks in a large project. The design structure matrix (DSM) is useful in identifying where iteration is necessary. The work transformation matrix model developed in this paper is a powerful extension of the DSM method which can predict slow and rapid convergence of iteration within a project, and predict those coupled features of the design problem which will require many iterations to reach a technical solution. This model is applied to an automotive brake-system development process in order to illustrate the model's utility in describing the main features of an actual design process.

J	Viswanathan, S; Mathur, K				Viswanathan, S; Mathur, K			Integrating routing and inventory decisions in one-warehouse multiretailer multiproduct distribution systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						integrated inventory and vehicle routing; multiechelon multiproduct distribution systems; power-of-two policies	JOINT REPLENISHMENT PROBLEM; PARTITIONING PROBLEM; RETAILER SYSTEMS; COSTS; TRANSPORTATION; GROUPINGS; NETWORKS; BOUNDS	We consider distribution systems with a central warehouse and many retailers that stock a number of different products. Deterministic demand occurs at the retailers for each product. The warehouse acts as a break-bulk center and does not keep any inventory. The products are delivered from the warehouse to the retailers by vehicles that combine the deliveries to several retailers into efficient vehicle routes. The objective is to determine replenishment policies that specify the delivery quantities and the vehicle routes used for the delivery, so as to minimize the long-run average inventory and transportation costs. A new heuristic that develops a stationary nested joint replenishment policy for the problem is presented in this paper. Unlike existing methods, the proposed heuristic is capable of solving problems involving distribution systems with multiple products. Results of a computational study on randomly generated single-product problems are also presented.

J	Dasu, S; delaTorre, J				Dasu, S; delaTorre, J			Optimizing an international network of partially owned plants under conditions of trade liberalization	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						international operations; multiplant networks; synthetic fiber industry; Latin America	CARTEL; INFORMATION; PRICE	For the last four decades the preferred economic philosophy in much of Latin America was that of import-substituting industrialization. As a result multinational corporations (MNCs) approached different countries with the expectation that each plant would primarily serve its domestic market. Each of these plants was partially owned by the MNC. Beginning in the late 1980s, Latin America countries began decreasing barriers to cross-border trade. This made competition between the units belonging to a common network possible for the first time. Operations which had subsisted side by side in spite of differences in costs and quality of output, and which were under the control of different owners now found themselves in competition with one another and having to rationalize their efforts. In this paper we analyze the problem of operating a network of plants under conditions of free trade and exchange rate fluctuations, when the firms that compose it are partially-owned subsidiaries of an MNC. A model of three subsidiaries and four countries is developed for one industry, based on actual corporate and economic data. We study the problem of coordinating the activities of the subsidiaries and allocating the gains arising from coordination.

J	Moinzadeh, K				Moinzadeh, K			Replenishment and stocking policies for inventory systems with random deal offerings	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory management; random deal offerings; stocking policies; price discounts		This paper considers the replenishment and stocking decision for inventory systems in which price discounts, referred to as deals, are offered by the supplier (or the market place) at random points in time. Assuming that the demand is constant over time, the times between deal offerings are exponentially distributed and that the order leadtimes are negligible, we derive expressions for evaluating the operating characteristics of the model. Moreover, we derive expressions for determining the optimal policy parameters for such systems and present results on the behavior of the optimal policy parameters. Our results are easy to implement, intuitive and provide managerial insights and a better understanding on the effect of random deal offerings on replenishment and stocking decisions. In addition, we suggest a back of envelope heuristic solution for deriving the policy parameters.		Moinzadeh, K (reprint author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH BUSINESS ADM,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.

J	Dutta, S; Weiss, AM				Dutta, S; Weiss, AM			The relationship between a firm's level of technological innovativeness and its pattern of partnership agreements	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						domestic and foreign interfirm partnership agreements; patent citations; tacit knowledge; technological innovativeness	JOINT VENTURES; INTEGRATION; COMPETITION; INDUSTRY	In this paper we investigate the relationship between the level of a firm's technological innovativeness and its pattern of partnership agreements (i.e., relative number of partnership agreements of one type versus another). We argue that the protection of tacit technological knowledge from potential opportunism is of importance to technologically innovative firms, and as a result they tend to have a relatively larger number of partnership agreements which generally minimize the transfer of tacit technological knowledge. Specifically, they tend to have a greater number of marketing agreements than joint ventures and a greater number of licensing agreements than joint ventures. This argument is tested using data from manufacturing firms in the electrical and electronics machinery sector who invest in R&D, and our results hold for our focal firm's agreements with both domestic and foreign partners. We discuss the strategic and policy implications from this research. In particular, the empirical results suggest that technologically innovative firms already have relatively more agreements which are likely to preempt transfer of their tacit technological knowledge to their foreign partners. Thus, recent suggestions of more active government regulation in the area of intellectual property may be unwarranted.

J	Smidts, A				Smidts, A			The relationship between risk attitude and strength of preference: A test of intrinsic risk attitude	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision analysis; utility theory; utility assessment; value assessment; relative risk aversion	UTILITY MEASUREMENT; DECISION; BIAS	In a field study, the concept of intrinsic risk attitude is investigated. Intrinsic risk attitude I concerns the relationship between risk attitude, measured by the utility function u(x), and strength of preference, measured by the value function v(x). We study farmers' decision-making vis-a-vis price risk and obtain assessments of risk attitude and strength of preference in two consecutive years in a sample of 253 respondents. This design enables us to investigate the temporal stability of intrinsic risk attitude. Our findings show that risk attitude and strength of preference are two distinctive constructs. More specifically, the hypothesis of a linear relationship between u(x) and v(x) is clearly rejected in favor of an exponential relationship. This exponential relationship implies that our respondents exhibit a constant absolute intrinsic risk attitude for different price levels, during a time period. Differences between respondents in direction and degree of intrinsic risk attitude are substantial and the majority of the respondents are intrinsically risk seeking. No statistically significant change in intrinsic risk attitude could be detected between the two years of measurement. However, the correlation between measures across time appears to be low. In the discussion, issues for further research are identified.		Smidts, A (reprint author), ERASMUS UNIV ROTTERDAM,ROTTERDAM SCH MANAGEMENT,POB 1738,NL-3000 DR ROTTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.

J	Boudoukh, J; Richardson, M; Whitelaw, RF				Boudoukh, J; Richardson, M; Whitelaw, RF			Nonlinearities in the relation between the equity risk premium and the term structure	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						equity risk premium; predictability; nonlinearity; nonparametric	ASSET PRICING-MODELS; NON-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION; STOCK RETURNS; UNITED-STATES; MARKETS; CONSUMPTION; VOLATILITY; PRICES	This paper investigates the relation between the conditional expected equity risk premium and the slope of the term structure of interest rates. Theoretically, these variables are linked, the relation may be nonlinear, and negative risk premiums are consistent with equilibrium. Given these implications, we employ a nonparametric estimation technique to document the empirical relation between the risk premium and the slope of the term. structure using almost two hundred years of data. Of particular interest, the risk premium is increasing in the term structure slope; however, for either small or negative slopes, the risk premium is much more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, the empirical results imply negative expected equity risk premiums for some inverted term structures. Finally, variations in the risk premium do not appear to be related to variations in the variance of equity returns. We illustrate these features in a stylized consumption-based model, and provide the economic intuition behind the results.

J	Wilhelm, WE; Srinivasa, AV				Wilhelm, WE; Srinivasa, AV			Prescribing tactical response for oil spill clean up operations	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						spill clean up; tactical response; integer programming; heuristics	DECISION	The Tactical Decision Problem (TDP) associated with oil spill clean up operations prescribes the time-phased allocation of available components over the planning horizon so that the clean up requirement at each critical time point is met. The objective is to minimize response time to allow for the most effective clean up possible. In this paper, we formulate the TDP as a general integer program. We devise a method based on graph theory to efficiently generate response system types (RSTs), including constituent components, the locations from which each of the component types is obtained, and the staging area at which that RST is composed. We present several pre-processing methods and derive expressions for bounds on decision variables to facilitate solution. We then develop two heuristics to obtain approximate solutions to the TDP. The first heuristic is an LP-based method, while the second uses a combination of LP relaxation and branch and bound. The two heuristics are compared on problems that are based on realistic scenarios representing application in the Galveston Bay Area.

J	Weber, EU; Milliman, RA				Weber, EU; Milliman, RA			Perceived risk attitudes: Relating risk perception to risky choice	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						risk; risk perception; risk attitudes; risky choice	DECISION-MAKING; PROSPECT-THEORY; UTILITY; BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; GAMBLES; MODELS; MONEY	This paper provides empirical evidence that distinguishes between alternative conceptualizations of the risky decision making process. Two studies investigate whether cross-situational differences in choice behavior should be interpreted in the expected utility framework as differences in risk attitude (as measured by risk-averse vs. risk-seeking utility functions) or as differences in the perception of the relative riskiness of choice alternatives as permitted by risk-return interpretations of utility functions, leaving open the possibility of stable cross-situational risk preference as a personality trait. To this end, we propose a way of assessing a person's inherent risk preference that factors out individual and situational differences in risk perception. We document that a definition of risk aversion and risk seeking as the preference for options perceived to be more risky or less risky, respectively, provides the cross-situational stability to a person's risk preference that has eluded more traditional definitions. In Experiment 1, commuters changed their preferences for trains with risky arrival times when the alternatives involved gains in commuting time rather than losses. However, changes in preference coincided with changes in the perception of the riskiness of the choice alternatives, leaving the perceived risk attitudes of a majority of commuters unchanged. Experiment 2, a stockmarket investment task, investigated changes in risk perception, information acquisition, and stock selection as a function of outcome feedback. Investors' stock selections and their perception of the risk of the same stocks were different in a series of decisions in which they lost money than in a series in which they made money. As in Experiment 1, differences in choice and in risk perception were systematically related, such that the majority of investors had the same preference for perceived risk in both series of decisions. Our results provide empirical support for the usefulness of recent risk-return conceptualizations of risky choice (Bell 1995, Jia and Dyer 1994, M. Weber and Sarin 1993).

J	Du, YF; Hall, R				Du, YF; Hall, R			Fleet sizing and empty equipment redistribution for center-terminal transportation networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							MODEL	Fleet sizing and empty equipment redistribution are important issues in managing transportation systems. Most of the mathematical models that have been developed for these problems are complex and computationally demanding, including dynamic linear programming and stochastic/dynamic mathematical programs. Our research takes an alternate approach by building from inventory theory and developing decentralized stock control policies for empty equipment. This approach is applied to hub-and-spoke networks (i.e., center-terminal networks), by first analytically modeling the stochastic processes representing various stock-control variables, and then comparing the analytical results to monte-carlo simulations. A decomposition approach is also developed to determine stock-out probabilities as a function of the fleet size as a whole, and as a function of localized control parameters.

A high rate usually implies that each worker processes many pieces per hour, enough so that work can be described as a deterministic hourly flow rate rather than, say, a stochastic number of discrete entities. Examples include mail processing and sorting, check processing, telephoned order processing, and inspecting and packaging of certain foods. Exogenous work may enter the factory at any workstation according to any time-of-day profile. Work-in-progress flows through the factory in discrete time according to Markovian routings. Workers, who in general are cross-trained, may work part time or full time shifts, may start work only at designated shift starting times, and may change job assignments at mid shift. In order to smooth the flow of work-in-progress through the service factory, work-in-progress may be temporarily inventoried (in buffers) at work stations. The objective is to schedule the workers (and correspondingly, the workflow) in a manner that minimizes labor costs subject to a variety of service-level, contractual and physical constraints. Motivated in part by analysis techniques of discrete time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, an object-oriented linear programming (OOLP) model is developed. Using exogenous input work profiles typical of large U.S. mail processing facilities, illustrative computational results are included.

J	Archibald, TW; Sassen, SAE; Thomas, LC				Archibald, TW; Sassen, SAE; Thomas, LC			An optimal policy for a two depot inventory problem with stock transfer	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory systems; Markov decision models; dynamic programming	EMERGENCY LATERAL TRANSSHIPMENTS; SYSTEMS; MULTIPERIOD	Multiple depot inventory systems with stock transfer are used by many companies especially when demand is high relative to storage capacity. The key issues in such systems are how many of each item to hold at each depot and what to do if there is a demand for an item at a depot that has none of that item in stock. This study was motivated by the inventory problem faced by a UK car part retailer that groups its depots into pairs. The company's policy for dealing with a demand at a depot that cannot be satisfied from local stock is to either transfer the item from the other depot in the group or to place an emergency order. The object of this paper is to characterise an optimal policy for this problem and to propose a method of calculating the parameters of such a policy.

We explore the joint optimization of contract parameters and inventory control policy in such environments. We first. model and derive the optimal periodic review inventory policy corresponding to a given supply contract, which generates piecewise-linear convex ordering costs. The optimal policy has two critical levels, and there is a range of stock levels for which the quantity ordered equals the contract volume. To numerically compute the critical levels, we model consecutive inventory levels as a Markov Chain, whose steady-state distribution is used to compute the holding, shortage and transportation costs. We then use the resulting total costs to derive the optimal contract volume. Various examples are provided. The optimal contracted delivery frequency can also be computed.

Using linear programming results, it is shown that this technique is sensible only if the yield of a bond is a linear function of its duration measures. Utilizing this result the paper analyzes the relative importance of the duration constraints. Former studies have hinted that the first order duration may be the most important. It is shown here there is no reason to satisfy the first duration constraint with priority over satisfaction of a higher order duration constraint. practitioners who use duration techniques for portfolio immunization must be aware of such an important counter-intuitive result.

Such lower and upper bounds are obtained minimizing and maximizing, respectively, the objective function of a nonlinear optimization problem. An explicit formula (related to an exponential utility function) is given for the special case of three states of nature. A large number of experiments have been carried out and the numerical results support the conjecture that the same formula holds for problems with a number of states n > 3. Moreover, DARA bounds are more efficient than the bounds obtained using different criteria.		Basso, A (reprint author), UNIV VENICE, DEPT MATH APPL, VENICE, ITALY.

In this paper, we examine the issue: do organizations need to employ costly designs in order to exhibit high performance in a dynamic situation. In the context of a computational framework we derive a set of logically consistent propositions about the interrelationship among task, opportunities for review, training, and cost and their relative impact on organizational performance. Our analyses indicate that complex organizational designs have drawbacks and design is often not the dominant factor affecting performance. The relationship between organizational complexity (hence cost) and performance is complex and depends on the level of time pressure, training, and the task environment. Within the context of the computational framework, we find that the benefits of re-thinking decisions and of matching the organizational design to the task environment are questionable. Further, these results suggest that applying scarce resources to mitigate the adverse impact of time pressure may have more impact on performance than using those resources to support a more complex organizational design.

J	Sherali, HD; Tuncbilek, CH				Sherali, HD; Tuncbilek, CH			Static and dynamic time-space strategic models and algorithms for multilevel rail-car meet management	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						fleet sizing; dynamic time-space network; strategic planning models; rail-car management	FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION	This paper deals with the design of dynamic time-space and calibrated static strategic planning models, along with solution algorithms, for the multilevel rail-car fleet management problem faced by RELOAD(R), a branch of the Association of American Railroads (AAR). We discuss a prevalent fleet sizing management model that is static in nature, and propose an alternative dynamic model based on a time-space network representation. This model accurately represents the problem, and also provides information regarding the issue of storing and retrieving empty cars. A suitable decomposition heuristic, that is based on solving subproblems defined for overlapping time segments, is developed to solve this model. This heuristic is shown to recover an optimal solution for all the test problems with a reasonable effort. We also investigate a procedure for calibrating the static model based on this improved time-space representation. Our results show that for the static model, a calibrated use of available data can yield near-optimal total fleet size requirements. This enables the use of such a simple, calibrated static model for accurately conducting fleet sizing, the determination of fleet size allocations among railroads, as well as for analyzing various ''what-if'' scenarios. The proposed methodology is being currently implemented at the AAR, and the status of this process as well as some test results are presented.

Optimal promotion strategies: A demand-sided characterization	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						retail promotions; pricing; mixed strategies		We generalize Narasimhan's (1988) model of retail promotion to include multiple products and general demand functions. Doing so allows us to further characterize optimal promotion strategies. We find that firms prefer to offer deeper promotions on products for which switching customers have stronger demand than loyal customers and/or for which the price sensitivity of demand is high for both switching and loyal customers. We further show that firms will offer deeper promotions on products which enjoy complementary relationships with other products that they sell rather than on products for which the firm sells a substitute.

However, despite their pervasive use in practice, there have been no reported empirical tests of these tools. One goal of the present research was to provide an empirical test of the evocative knowledge map methodology. Second, a theoretical analysis of probability assessment was used to develop a new prescriptive elicitation technique. This technique uses a theoretically-grounded set of directed questions to help decision makers evoke information for probability assessment. Experimental results showed that both the knowledge map and the new directed questions methodology elicited a higher quantity and quality of information from decision makers engaged in probability assessment tasks than did a control condition. Further, the information elicited by the two techniques was qualitatively different, suggesting that the two methods might profitably be used as complementary elicitation techniques.

Aggregated analyses	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						fairness; envy; social risk; distributive justice; aggregated benefits and risks	PUBLIC RISKS; EQUITY; ENVY	This paper is the second of a two-paper study of fairness issues for decisions that affect the benefits received and the risks encountered by a population. The study examines fairness for individuals and for homogeneous groups within the population. It considers fairness both for population benefit-risk profiles and for probability distributions over profiles. Our study bases fairness on notions of envy among individuals and groups. The first paper focused on fairness in profiles and profile distributions when benefits and risks are not aggregated. The present paper uses individual preferences to assess fairness when benefits and risks are aggregated within groups or over the population.

In manufacturing applications, ''quality'' is often defined as conformance to specifications or as meeting standards on the performance of the product. In the marketing and economics literature, ''quality'' typically refers to the performance level or ''class'' of the product. To capture both perspectives, a product is described by a vector of performance attributes, and the population of produced units is assumed to display a distribution on these attributes. The distribution perceived by customers may differ from the actual. The attribute levels (means) may be taken to define the class, or performance of the product. Quality in the sense of conformance is then conceptually identified with the absence of variation of the population. Consumer preferences are modelled by a cardinal utility function defined on the vector of attributes and price, and customers maximize expected utility. Product manufacturers are assumed to face a cost of producing a given population distribution. Under specific assumptions regarding costs and utility functions, models of monopoly, oligopoly and perfect competition are formulated. The model clarifies the distinction between product class (performance) and conformance quality, identifies the sources of quality improvement, and provides an economic framework relating issues like product positioning, process improvement, quality function deployment (QFD) and customer preference estimation. This framework is used to address issues such as quality costs and benefits and the economics of investments in quality.

J	Lee, HL; Tang, CS				Lee, HL; Tang, CS			Modelling the costs and benefits of delayed product differentiation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						product/process redesign; product differentiation; mathematical models		Expanding product variety and high customer service provision are both major challenges for manufacturers to compete in the global market. in addition to many ongoing programs, such as lead-time reduction, redesigning products and processes so as to delay the point of product differentiation is becoming an emerging means to address these challenges. Such a strategy calls for redesigning products and processes so that the stages of the production process in which a common process is used are prolonged. This product/process redesign will defer the point of differentiation (i.e., defer the stage after which the products assume their unique identities). In this paper, we develop a simple model that captures the costs and benefits associated with this redesign strategy. We apply this simple model to analyze some special cases that are motivated by real examples. These special cases enable us to formalize three different product/process redesign approaches (standardization, modular design, and process restructuring) for delaying product differentiation that some companies are beginning to pursue. Finally, we analyze some special theoretical cases that enable us to characterize the optimal point of product differentiation and derive managerial insights.

J	Fruchter, GE; Kalish, S				Fruchter, GE; Kalish, S			Closed-loop advertising strategies in a duopoly	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing-competitive strategy; Nash equilibrium; bilinear-quadratic differential game; noncooperative	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS	Using the Lanchester model to describe the dynamics of the market where two firms compete fur customers by advertising, we solve the problem of determining an optimal advertising strategy for maximum discounted profits. We develop both open- and closed-loop strategies and explain the relationship between them. Using a new mathematical approach, we prove that our closed-loop solution is a global Nash equilibrium. The closed-loop strategy is time-variant and depends linearly on the actual market share. The time-variant coefficient incorporates the discount factor; its computation requires the solution of a backward differential equation and a set of two nonlinear differential equations for an initial value problem. The closed-loop advertising expenditures are proportional to the open-loop advertising expenditures and to the square of the competitor's actual market share. This provides a very practical adaptive control rule that allows the manager to adjust the actual advertising expenditure and tit deviate from budget. We illustrate the use of our control rule, using data fur the period 1968-1984 of the Cola War. Marketing implications of the results are provided.

J	Bitran, GR; Mondschein, SV				Bitran, GR; Mondschein, SV			Periodic pricing of seasonal products in retailing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic pricing; retailing; stochastic models; dynamic programming	DEMAND; SALES	This paper studies intertemporal pricing policies when selling seasonal products in retail stores. We first present a continuous time model where a seller laces a stochastic arrival of customers with different valuations of the product. For this model, we characterize the optimal pricing policies as functions of time and inventory. We use this model as a benchmark against which we compare more realistic models that consider periodic pricing reviews. We show that the structure of the optimal pricing policies in this case is consistent with the procedures observed in practice; retail stores successively discount the product during the season and promote a liquidation sale at the end of the planning horizon. We also show that the loss experienced when implementing periodic pricing reviews instead of continuous policies is small when the appropriate number of reviews is chosen. Several interesting economic insights emerge from our analysis. For example, uncertainty in the demand for new products leads to higher prices, larger discounts, and more unsold inventory. Finally, we study the effect of announced discount policies on prices and profits. We show that stores that have adopted this type of strategy usually set prices such that with high probability the merchandise is sold during the first periods and the largest discounts rarely take place.

J	Green, LV; Kolesar, PJ				Green, LV; Kolesar, PJ			The lagged PSA for estimating peak congestion in multiserver Markovian queues with periodic arrival rates	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queues; nonstationarity; approximations	POINTWISE STATIONARY APPROXIMATION; POLICE PATROL; MODEL	We propose using a modification of the simple peak hour approximation (SPHA) for estimating peak congestion in multiserver queueing systems with exponential service times and time-varying periodic Poisson arrivals. This lagged pointwise stationary approximation (lagged PSA) is obtained by first estimating the time of the actual peak congestion by the time of peak congestion in an infinite server model and then substituting the arrival rate at this time in the corresponding stationary finite server model. We show that the lagged PSA is always more accurate than the SPHA and results in dramatically smaller errors when average service times are greater than a half an hour (based on a 24 hour period). More importantly, the lagged PSA reliably identifies proper staffing levels to meet targeted performance levels to keep congestion low.

We frame these measures in the context of evolving product families in the technology-based firm. Our goal is to more clearly understand the dynamics of platform renewal and derivative product generation and their consequences fur long-term success. We explore the utility of the proposed methods with data gathered from a large measurement systems manufacturer. We find that the methods and measures can help management assess the technological and market leverage achieved from the firm's present and past product platforms. This provides a foundation for transforming single-product, single-period planning processes into a multi-product, multi-period form that embraces the product family and the renewal of product architecture. The research also shows the need to integrate data from engineering, manufacturing, and sales organizations to produce information for managing the growth of the firm's product families.

J	Wohl, A				Wohl, A			The feasibility of an index-contingent trading mechanism	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stock exchanges; trading systems; call trading; limit orders; security indexes; market microstructure	STOCK-MARKET; VOLATILITY; SECURITIES	''Auction'' or ''call'' trading systems are used in many stock exchanges. An essential problem in the application of these systems is that orders in one security cannot be conditioned on prices of other securities. This payer proposes and analyzes the feasibility of an index-contingent trading system. in this system, limit orders may be conditioned on an index (any weighted average of the security prices that is determined simultaneously with the prices) in addition to the asset price. Without any assumptions about traders' behavior it is shown that under a reasonable restriction on the structure of the limit orders, there is a unique solution (vector of prices) to any set of orders in all securities. Moreover, the paper presents a quick and simple algorithm that converges to the solution. This algorithm is based on an extension of the current mechanisms; therefore it can be implemented easily in any computerized auction system.

J	Brynjolfsson, E; Kemerer, CF				Brynjolfsson, E; Kemerer, CF			Network externalities in microcomputer software: An econometric analysis of the spreadsheet market	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						network externalities; standards; pricing; software; hedonic regression; information technology	PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION; IMPLICIT MARKETS; HEDONIC PRICES; COMPATIBILITY; INNOVATIONS; COMPETITION; ADOPTION	Because of network externalities, the success of a software product may depend in part on stalled base and its conformance to industry standards. This research builds a hedonic model to determine the effects of network externalities, standards, intrinsic features and a time trend on microcomputer spreadsheet software prices. When data for a sample of products during the 1987-1992 time period were analyzed using this model, four main results emerged: 1) Network externalities, as measured by the size of a product's installed base, significantly increased the price of spreadsheet products: a one percent increase in a product's installed base was associated with a 0.75% increase in its price. 2) Products which adhered to the dominant standard, the Lotus menu tree interface, commanded prices which were higher by an average of 46%. 3) Although nominal prices increased slightly during this time period, quality-adjusted prices declined by an average of 16% per year. 4) The hedonic model was found to be a good predictor of actual market prices, despite the fact that it was originally estimated using list prices. Several variations of the model were examined, and, while the qualitative findings were robust, the precise estimates of the coefficients varied somewhat depending on the sample of products examined, the weighting of the observations and the functional form used in estimation, suggesting that the use of hedonic methods in this domain is subject to a number of limitations due, inter alia, to the potential for strategic pricing by vendors.

The Organizational Consultant is a knowledge base expert system to help design organizations. That is, it takes facts about the environment, size, strategy, technology, ownership, and management preferences and applies the knowledge base to recommend the design structure and properties such as complexity, formalization, centralization, and span of control, among others. Organization theory is comprised of numerous positive contingency theories, which are not integrated. The main issue is to create a comprehensive and consistent knowledge base from what we know, i.e., create a useful synthesis. We utilize four fit criteria as a guide: contingency fit, design parameter fit, situation fit, and total parameter fit. Contingency fit demands that the knowledge base of ''if-then'' rules follow what we know from the literature. Design parameter fit requires a balance, or weighting, among the supporting and opposing design recommendations. Situation fit assures us that the situation itself is not inconsistent. Finally, total design fit requires that it is useable and helpful to recommend structure and properties to attain goals. The development of the Organizational Consultant is a continuing validation exercise. The size of an organization is an important design contingency. Yet, an operational definition of size for design purposes has been wanting. We discuss how a useful definition of size was developed for the Organizational Consultant. We describe the development of the Organizational Consultant--a knowledge-based expert system that utilizes a synthesis of the elements of organizational contingency theory through a validation process. The four fit criteria were applied to guide the development process.

J	OLeary, DE				OLeary, DE			Verification of uncertain knowledge-based systems: An empirical verification approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						knowledge-based systems; expert systems; uncertainty in AI; verification and validation	EXPERT SYSTEMS; VALIDATION; WEIGHTS	A number of different tests and approaches are developed to determine the existence of potential anomalies in rule-based systems that employ MYCIN uncertainty factors (weights). First, the distribution of weights is compared to other systems' distributions and weights are investigated as to their individual meanings, to determine whether any weights are unusual. Second, there is increasing evidence that people are not ''good'' at developing weights on rules, building in symmetries and redundancies that signal ''usual'' assumptions about the underlying probabilities. Accordingly, weight symmetries generated from rule pairs are analyzed to determine the existence of anomalies. Third, typically rule-based tools have been developed for application in specific domains, such as medicine. Unique aspects of those domains may limit application of the tools to other domains. Finally, ad hoc, rule-based approaches are suboptimal, and alternative formal probability approaches, such as Bayes' nets, more fully specify the probabilistic nature of knowledge. The paper is part of the empirical verification literature, where verification is done on an actual system and the system provides data that indicates the kinds of anomalies that can be expected. A case study is used to illustrate each of the verification tests and concerns.		OLeary, DE (reprint author), UNIV SO CALIF,3660 TROUSDALE PKWY,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089, USA.

In rank-dependent utility theories, including prospect theory, the probability weighting function permits probabilities to be weighted nonlinearly. Previous empirical studies of the weighting function have suggested an inverse S-shaped function, first concave and then convex. However, these studies suffer from a methodological shortcoming: estimation procedures have required assumptions about the functional form of the value and/or weighting functions. We propose two preference conditions that are necessary and sufficient for concavity and convexity of the weighting function. Empirical tests of these conditions are independent of the form of the value function. We test these conditions using preference ''ladders'' (a series of questions that differ only by a common consequence). The concavity-convexity ladders validate previous findings of an S-shaped weighting function, concave up to p < 0.40, and convex beyond that probability. The tests also show significant nonlinearity away from the boundaries, 0 and 1. Finally, we fit the ladder data with weighting functions proposed by Tversky and Kahneman (1992) and Prelec (1995).

J	Jia, JM; Dyer, JS				Jia, JM; Dyer, JS			A standard measure of risk and risk-value models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ORSA/TIMS Joint National Meeting	NOV, 1993	PHOENIX, AZ	ORSA, TIMS		risk; utility theory; risk-value models; portfolio optimization	CONJOINT; UTILITY	In this paper we propose a standard measure of risk that is based on the converted expected utility of normalized lotteries with zero-expected values. This measure of risk has many desirable properties that characterize the notion of risk. It is very general and includes many previously proposed measures of risk as special cases. Moreover, our standard measure of risk provides a preference-based and unified method for risk studies. Since the standard measure of risk is compatible with the measure of expected utility, it can be used explicitly or implicitly in an expected utility model. Under a condition called risk independence, a decision could be made by explicitly trading off between risk and value, which offers an alternative representation of the expected utility model, named the standard risk-value model. Finally, we discuss some other applications of the standard measure of risk and extensions of our risk-value tradeoff framework for descriptive decision making.

Objects of random weight and reward arrive according to a stochastic process in time. The weights and rewards associated with the objects are distributed according to a known probability distribution. Each object can either be accepted to be loaded into the knapsack, of known weight capacity, or be rejected. The objective is to determine the optimal policy for loading the knapsack within a fixed time horizon so as to maximize the expected accumulated reward. The optimal decision rules are derived and are shown to exhibit surprising behavior in some cases. it is also shown that if the distribution of the weights is concave, then the decision rules behave according to intuition.

J	Andersen, ED; Ye, YY				Andersen, ED; Ye, YY			Combining interior-point and pivoting algorithms for linear programming	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						interior-point algorithm; simplex method; linear program	POLYNOMIAL-TIME ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE	We propose a new approach to combine linear programming (LP) interior-point and simplex pivoting algorithms. In any iteration of an interior-point algorithm we construct a related LP problem, which approximates the original problem, with a known (strictly) complementary primal-dual solution pair. Thus, we can apply Megiddo's (1991) pivoting procedure to compute an optimal basis for the approximate problem in strongly polynomial time. We show that, if the approximate problem is constructed from an interior-point iterate sufficiently close to the optimal face, then any optimal basis of the approximate problem is an optimal basis for the original problem. If the LP data are rational, the total number of interior-point iterations to create such a sufficient approximate problem is bounded by a polynomial in the data size. We develop a modification of Megiddo's procedure and discuss several implementation issues in solving the approximate problem. We also report encouraging computational results for this combined approach.

J	Tzur, M				Tzur, M			Learning in setups: Analysis, minimal forecast horizons, and algorithms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						learning in setups; general setup cost function; minimal forecast horizon	LOT-SIZING MODELS; EXISTENCE; TIME	We analyze the dynamic lot-sizing model in which the cost of a setup depends on the number of setups that have occurred prior to it. This arises, for example, when there exist learning effects in setups. Our model is more general than most learning models in the literature since it allows the total setup cost to be a general nondecreasing (but not necessarily concave) function of the number of setups. We explore tight relationships between our model and special cases of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model. On the basis of these we find minimal forecast and planning horizons for our model, which determine the first decision when the model is solved on a rolling horizon basis. When a forecast horizon cannot be found, we provide guidelines regarding the optimal first decision. We also provide an algorithm to solve the finite horizon problem, which uses as subproblems variations of the classical dynamic lot-sizing problem. The advantage of this approach is the ability to use the extensive literature available on the latter, to generalize the results of this paper. As many of our results are qualitative in nature, they provide insights which can be useful for other models with a similar setup cost behavior.

J	Johnson, ME; Jackman, J				Johnson, ME; Jackman, J			Interval coverage in multiclass queues using batch mean estimates	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; statistical analysis; queues; limit theorems	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SIMULATION OUTPUT	We investigate the fixed, sample-size, batch-mean procedure for creating confidence intervals from simulated data obtained from a stochastic queueing system with multiple customer classes. We show that, for a multiclass M/M/1 queue, serial correlation between customers of the same class decreases to zero as the number of customer classes increases. We also derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic variance of waiting time by customer type. We then empirically examine batch-mean estimator coverage for a simple queue with multiple customer classes. We find that batch-mean estimators perform better in terms of coverage and interval half width in multiclass queues, with a fixed number of observations per class, than in the traditionally studied single-class systems. We also examine the effect of multiple classes where the total computational effort remains fixed.

J	Chintagunta, PK; Rao, VR				Chintagunta, PK; Rao, VR			Pricing strategies in a dynamic duopoly: A differential game model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						competitive strategy; pricing; differential games	ADVERTISING STRATEGIES; BRAND-CHOICE; COMPETITION; EQUILIBRIUM; PRODUCTS; MARKET; DEMAND	We formulate a differential game model for dynamic pricing in a duopolistic market. Firms' demand functions are derived from utility maximizing behavior of consumers with the demand for a brand given by the legit model. Preferences for brands are assumed to evolve over time in the market in a manner akin to learning models postulated in the marketing literature. We derive the differential equations governing the equilibrium open-loop price paths over time and show that in steady state, the brand with the higher preference level charges the higher price. The formulation is extended to include the effects of consumer heterogeneity, and equilibrium steady-state prices are compared with those obtained when heterogeneity is ignored. A comparison of steady-state dynamic prices with myopic prices is provided. An empirical example is discussed to show how steady-state model predictions may be obtained from actual longitudinal purchase data.

All formulae are surprisingly efficacious in determining the best multiattribute alternative. Rank order centroid (ROC) weights are more accurate than the other rank-based formulae; furthermore, the ROC formula generalizes to incorporate both other forms of partial information about attribute weights and partial rank order information as well. Because a ROC-based analysis is so straightforward and efficacious, it provides an appropriate implementation tool.

J	Gollier, C				Gollier, C			Repeated optional gambles and risk aversion	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						repeated gambles; dynamic risk taking; properness		We analyze in this paper the effect of age on the optimal dynamic strategy toward repeated independent gambles. When deciding to accept or to reject a lottery that is offered today, the gambler knows how many lotteries can yet be played in the future. We first characterize the optimal dynamic strategy when future lotteries are identically distributed. We show that the existence of future lotteries always increases the willingness to gamble today. When the sequence of lotteries is independent but not identically distributed, we show that this does not need to be true. This analysis can be applied to the problem of investing in indivisible risky investment projects, or to the problem of dynamic optimal insurance demand.

J	Tagaras, G; Lee, HL				Tagaras, G; Lee, HL			Economic models for vendor evaluation with quality cost analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						quality costs; vendor evaluation; production	SELECTION	Successful vendor-vendee relationship is viewed as an important ingredient for maintaining competitiveness in the current marketplace. This calls for a careful and comprehensive approach in selecting vendors. The cost of quality (or better phrased as the cost of ''unquality'') resulted from imperfections of a vendor's incoming input materials is one component of the total costs in the evaluation of vendors. The purpose of this paper is to show that looking at only one dimension of the quality cost is not sufficient and to highlight the importance of having a high quality internal process. We explore the relationship between the vendor's quality cost, the vendor's input quality, and the imperfections of the manufacturing process. We analyze the properties of the resulting quality cost model, and draw managerial implications in the selection of vendors.

We first analyze problems in which the cost of a job is given by a general nondecreasing, convex function F of the absolute deviation of its completion time from a (common) unrestrictive due-date, and the objective is to minimize the sum of the costs incurred for all N jobs. (A special case to which considerable attention is given is the completion time variance problem.) We derive an easily computable lower bound for the minimum cost value and a simple ''Alternating Schedule'' heuristic, both of which are computable in O(N log N) time. Under mild technical conditions with respect to F, we show that the worst case optimality (accuracy) gap of the heuristic (lower bound) is bounded by a constant as well. as by a simple function of a single measure of the dispersion among the processing times. We also show that the heuristic (bound) is asymptotically optimal (accurate) and characterize the convergence rate as O(N-2) under very general conditions with respect to the function F. In addition, we report on a numerical study showing that the average gap is less than 1% even for problems with 30 jobs, and that it falls below 0.1% for problems with 90 or more jobs. This study also establishes that the empirical gap is almost perfectly proportional with N-2, as verified by a regression analysis. Finally, we generalize the heuristic to settings with a possibly restrictive due date and general asymmetric, and possibly nonconvex, earliness and tardiness cost functions and demonstrate its excellent performance via a second numerical study.

J	Robinson, EP; Gao, LL				Robinson, EP; Gao, LL			A dual ascent procedure for multiproduct dynamic demand coordinated replenishment with backlogging	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory/multi-item; hotsizing; branch and bound; integer	UNCAPACITATED FACILITY LOCATION; LOG N); ALGORITHM; TIME	This paper describes a mixed-integer programming formulation and dual ascent based branch-and-bound algorithm for the multiproduct dynamic demand coordinated replenishment problem with backlogging. The single sourcing properties of the formulation and the hierarchical structure of the fixed-charge and continuous variables yield an extremely tight linear programming relaxation for the problem. A branch-and-bound algorithm based on Erlenkotter's dual ascent, dual adjustment, and primal construction concepts exploits these properties to obtain an efficient solution procedure. Computational results indicate that the new procedures find optimal solutions in less than five percent of the computational time of the most efficient previous algorithm. The heuristic performance of the procedures also demonstrate their superiority over existing approaches. We solved problems with 12 time periods and 20 products in 0.41 CPU seconds, and heuristic solutions with a worst-case three-percent optimality gap are found in 0.068 CPU seconds. The efficiency and large-scale capability of the procedures make their potential application in inventory requirements planning systems promising.

J	EbenChaime, M				EbenChaime, M			Parametric solution for linear bicriteria knapsack models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						programming multiple criteria, solution for linear-bicriteria knapsack problems; network/graphs-applications, of the shortest path model	EFFICIENT	Linear weighing is a common approach to handle multiple criteria and the ''knapsack'' is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. A knapsack problem with two linearly weighted, objective criteria is considered in this paper For better support, it is important to provide the decision maker with information that covers the whole range of alternatives. Toward this goal, an algorithm for the construction of a parametric solution to the problem, i.e., for any combination of weights, is developed, which is based on finding a longest path in a network which compactly represents all feasible solutions to the knapsack problem. Exploiting the special structure of the knapsack model, the algorithm efficiently constructs the parametric solution in time that is linear in the product of the number of variables, the resource Limit (right-hand side of the constraint), and the (finite) number of vectors which constitute the solution. The amount of memory required is linear in the product of the number of variables and the resource Limit. Results of computational study are reported. The results are used to assess the efficiency of the algorithm and characterize its behavior with respect to the parameter values.

Hayes and Wheelwright, among others, argue that the emphasis given to product customization and other competitive priorities should agree with process choice. Our empirical study investigates whether firms actually link their process choice to product customization and other competitive priorities as hypothesized, and whether compatible decision patterns lead to better performance. Analysis of data collected from managers at 144 U.S. manufacturing plants shows a strong correlation between process choice, product customization, and competitive priorities. Process choice is highly related with the degree of product customization, and also with the emphasis placed on the quality and cost competitive priorities. Job shops and batch shops tend to have more product customization, higher costs, and higher quality. Some continuous flow shops use part commonality and flexible automation to achieve more customization than would otherwise be expected. Without these initiatives, customization in continuous flow shops results in weak performance.

Following Moenaert and Souder (1990), a causal model of the antecedents of information utility at the R&D/marketing-interface was postulated. A non-experimental critical incident method was used to test the model. The field survey involved 386 team members of 80 new product innovation teams in 40 companies. Path analysis was used to test the causal model. Support for several aspects of the model were found. First, the relevance and the credibility of the message had strong effects on the perception of information utility. The comprehensibility of the message had a moderate effect on the perception of information utility, whereas novelty had a small effect.

System productivity, to be maximized, is limited by the least productive (bottleneck) activity. We first review a basic bisection method that can solve this discrete, monotonic resource-allocation problem even with a nonlinear objective and constraints. We then generalize the basic algorithm to solve an enhanced version of the problem containing additional coupling constraints on the allocation decisions. This generalization applies to assembly-release planning (ARP) in a multiproduct assemble-to-forecast environment with part commonality. The ARP problem requires deciding the number of kits for each product to release for assembly in every time period, using the;available parts, to achieve if possible the target service levels for all products and time periods or minimize the maximum deviation of the actual service levels from the targets. We also consider extensions of the ARP model incorporating precedence constraints and part substitutability, and show how to modify the bisection method to solve these problems.

We try to choose s(t) so that the probability of a delay (before beginning service) hits or falls just below a target probability at all times. We develop an approximate procedure based on a time-dependent normal distribution, where the mean and variance are determined by infinite-sewer approximations. We demonstrate that this approximation is effective by making comparisons with the exact numerical solution of the Markovian M(t)/M/S-t model.

J	Icmeli, O; Erenguc, SS				Icmeli, O; Erenguc, SS			A branch and bound procedure for the resource constrained project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						project scheduling; resource constraints; net present value	NET PRESENT VALUE; MAXIMIZE; SEARCH	Management of projects is complicated by the scarcity of resources required to execute them. Limited resources usually extend the project completion times beyond those determined by CPM/PERT. Several solution procedures have been developed for solving the resource constrained project scheduling problem. One objective commonly used for these problems is to complete the project as early as possible (minimize makespan). The problem considered in this paper is a resource constrained project scheduling problem, with the added features that there are cash flows associated with the project activities, and the objective is to schedule the project activities in such a way that the net present value of cash flows is maximized. With these features the problem becomes financially motivated and more realistic. We introduce a branch and bound procedure to solve the resource constrained project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows. Our procedure exploits the known fact that potential resource violations can be eliminated by introducing additional precedence relations between certain project activities. Specifically, we use the ''minimal delaying alternatives'' concept to resolve resource conflicts. The bounds in the branch and bound procedure are computed by solving Payment Scheduling Problems, which can be formulated as linear programs and by that are well-solvable.

As that system evolves over time, so do the replenishment leadtimes. The optimal policy has the same structure as in standard models, but its parameters change dynamically to reflect current supply conditions. In this setting, contrary to conventional wisdom, a longer leadtime does not necessarily imply more inventory. The leadtime is important, but so is a concept we call order coverage.

The event to be predicted and individual predictions rendered are assumed to be discrete random variables. A measure of expert competence is defined using a distance metric between the actual outcome of the event and each expert's predicted outcome. Following Levy and Delic (1994), we use Shannon's information measure (Shannon 1948, Jaynes 1957) to derive aggregation rules for combining two or more expert predictions into a single aggregated prediction that appropriately calibrates different degrees of expert competence and reflects any dependence that may exist among the expert predictions. The resulting maximum entropy aggregated prediction is least prejudiced in the sense that it utilizes all information available but remains maximally noncommittal with regard to information not available. Numerical examples to illuminate the implications of maximum entropy aggregation are also presented.

J	Parsons, J				Parsons, J			An information model based on classification theory	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						conceptual information modeling; database design; classification theory; object model	METHODOLOGIES; MANAGEMENT; OBJECT; SYSTEM	This paper develops a formal information structuring model based on the premise that an information system represents knowledge about things in an organization. Since humans organize knowledge about things via categories or classes, the model is motivated by a theory of classification. The theory suggests several critical elements of classification based on the importance of classifying things to human survival. These elements are reflected by constructs in the model. Formal implications of the model for systems development are derived and strategies proposed for empirically evaluating these implications with respect to current modeling approaches. Necessary conditions are identified for a collection of classes to be considered a ''good'' model of some domain. The conditions permit different users to classify the same objects in different ways, depending on need. This suggests a new approach to data or object modeling which emphasizes instances and properties, rather than fixed categories of data or schemas. The model also offers insights into the role of classification in object-oriented analysis and design methodologies. Finally, a program of research is outlined in which the model is being used to develop and experimentally evaluate an information modeling methodology, and as a source of implementation primitives for ''instance-based'' data modeling.

J	Raju, JS; Srinivasan, V				Raju, JS; Srinivasan, V			Quota-based compensation plans for multiterritory heterogeneous salesforces	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						salesforce compensation; agency theory; sales quotas; salesforce management	SALES; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCT; MODEL	We compare quota-based salesforce compensation plans with the BLSS plan, i.e., the optimal curvilinear agency-theory-based compensation plans proposed in Basu, Lal, Srinivasan and Staelin (1985). A quota plan pays a fixed salary which is supplemented by commission income that is a prespecified fraction of the dollar sales that exceed the quota. For a salesforce comprised of multiple salespersons/territories, we consider a basic quota plan where the commission rate and salary remain the same across salespersons; however, quotas vary across salespersons/territories. Compared to the BLSS plan that is individually tailored to each salesperson/territory, the basic quota plan's total nonoptimality in profit has two components: (i) a shape-induced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the quota-based plan does not have the same optimal shape as the curvilinear BLSS plan, and (ii) a heterogeneity-induced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the salary and commission rate in the basic quota plan are constrained to be the same across the salesforce. Our numerical experiments indicate that the total nonoptimality is merely about 1% for the parametric scenarios studied. The basic quota plan is simpler to implement than the BLSS plan. Furthermore, changes in business conditions in a territory, or the transfer of a salesperson from one territory to another, can be accommodated by changing only the quota, without having to change the salary and the commission rate structure. Such advantages, together with our result that the nonoptimality is slight, suggest that quota-based plans offer considerable potential as a salesforce compensation scheme.

J	Dyer, D; Kagel, JH				Dyer, D; Kagel, JH			Bidding in common value auctions: How the commercial construction industry corrects for the winner's curse	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auctions; construction industry; winner's curse; field data; experiments	INFORMATION	Experienced construction industry executives suffer from a winner's curse in laboratory common value auction markets (Dyer et al. 1989). This paper identifies essential differences between field environments and the economic theory underlying the laboratory markets that account for the executives' success in the field and a winner's curse in the lab. These are (1) industry-specific mechanisms which enable contractors to escape the winner's curse even when they bid too low, (2) learned, industry-specific evaluative processes which enable experienced contractors to avoid the winner's curse in the first place, and (3) important private value elements that underlie bidding. Also identified are a number of industry-specific bidding characteristics whose evolution can be explained using modern auction theory. Lessons are drawn regarding the use of experimental methods in economics.	UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT ECON,PITTSBURGH,PA 15260	Dyer, D (reprint author), DYERWOLF CONSULTING,CRYSTAL BEACH,TX 77650, USA.

J	Peterson, MD				Peterson, MD			Two models for assessing a federal environmental health policy: The case of radon in US homes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						radon; indoor air; environment; government; programs		The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) strategy for reducing the public health risks of radon exposure depends largely on convincing the public to undertake testing and mitigation. In this context, important questions arise as to whether public response is likely to be high and thus whether changes in mortality are likely to be substantial. To explore these questions, we develop two models of the ''demographics'' of radon exposure in the United States. The first of these explores the sensitivity of projected mortality over the next 100 years to important policy variables such as testing and mitigation rates. The second model takes the analysis down to the level of the individual and estimates the distribution of risk across the population and the costs and benefits of mitigation accruing to a person who may change residence several times during his or her life. Our results show that realistic policy scenarios lead to moderate changes in mortality and that the cost-benefit calculation of the individual is unlikely to lead to high levels of public response. The results support the idea of a more focused public policy.		Peterson, MD (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,SCH PUBL & ENVIRONM AFFAIRS,BLOOMINGTON,IN 47405, USA.

J	Balas, E; Ceria, S; Cornuejols, G				Balas, E; Ceria, S; Cornuejols, G			Mixed 0-1 programming by lift-and-project in a branch-and-cut framework	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						integer programming; cutting planes; branch-and-bound; branch-and-cut	ALGORITHM	We investigate the computational issues that need to be addressed when incorporating general cutting planes for mixed 0-1 programs into a branch-and-cut framework. The cuts we use are of the lift-and-project variety. Some of the issues addressed have a theoretical answer, but others are of an experimental nature and are settled by comparing alternatives on a set of test problems. The resulting code is a robust solver for mixed 0-1 programs. We compare it with several existing codes. On a wide range of test problems it performs as well as, or better than, some of the best currently available mixed integer programming codes.

J	Jacobs, LW; Brusco, MJ				Jacobs, LW; Brusco, MJ			Overlapping start-time bands in implicit tour scheduling	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						integer programming; implicit formulation; personnel scheduling	SHIFT	Many organizations face personnel scheduling decisions under conditions of variable demand for service across a seven-day planning horizon. These organizations must assign employees to daily shifts that efficiently satisfy the demand for labor, yet allow adequate time for rest between subsequent shifts of an employee's weekly tour schedule. To meet these diverse objectives, managers may permit shifts to begin (and end) in any planning period of the day, but place bands on shift-start times to which individuals may be assigned on each day of their tour schedule. We present a compact integer programming model that implicitly represents start-time band scheduling flexibility. We demonstrate the new model by applying it to requirements for toll collectors on the Illinois Tollway. Problems requiring up to two million variables using a general set covering formulation were represented using the new implicit programming model and often solved to optimality in just a few minutes on a Pentium-based microcomputer. The results indicate that start-time bands can provide an important improvement in scheduling efficiency when compared to the exclusive use of schedules that require workers to begin work on the same hour of the day on each day of their tour.

We consider an environment in which a set of jobs must be scheduled over a set of parallel manufacturing cells, each consisting of a single machine, where the processing time of each job depends on the amount of resource allocated to the associated cell. Two versions of the problem are introduced: a static problem in which a single resource-allocation decision Is made and maintained throughout the production horizon, and a dynamic problem in which resource Can be reassigned among the production cells as local bottlenecks shift. We provide mathematical formulations for each version of the problem, establish problem complexity, identify important characteristics of optimal solutions, develop optimal and heuristic solution approaches, and report the results of a set of computational experiments. The computational results demonstrate that substantial improvements in operational performance can be achieved through effective utilization of resource flexibility.

The problem is to determine the set of calls and an assignment of them to the paths in an are-capacitated network to maximize profit. We propose an algorithm to solve the integer programming formulation of the problem. An efficient column generation technique to solve the linear programming relaxation is proposed, and a modified cover inequality is used to strengthen the IP formulation. The algorithm incorporates the column generation technique and the strong cutting plane approach into a branch-and-bound scheme. We test the proposed algorithm on some random problems. The results show that the algorithm can be used to solve the problems within reasonably small time limits.

J	Glasserman, P; Liu, TW				Glasserman, P; Liu, TW			Rare-event simulation for multistage production-inventory systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity-constrained inventory models; multiechelon inventory systems; service-level estimation; rare events; tail probabilities	RANDOM-WALKS; MONTE-CARLO; DEMANDS	We consider the problem of precise estimation of service-level measures in multistage production-inventory systems when the system is managed for high levels of service. Precisely because the service level is high, stockouts, large backorders, and unfilled demands are rare and thus difficult to estimate by straightforward simulation. We propose and analyze alternative estimators, based on changing the demand distribution to make these rare events less rare. Whereas straightforward simulation for a fixed relative error results in computational requirements that grow exponentially in certain stock-level parameters, the requirements for our importance sampling estimators remain bounded for all parameter values. We provide bounds making it possible to determine the maximum number of replications required before any are generated. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Individual level analysis applied to data obtained from two separate studies suggests that the scales produce fairly similar results: The inter-response mode correlations were high, and individual plots comparing various methods were quite similar. Covariance structure models based on multitrait-multimethod matrices are utilized to assess the reliability and method variance of the scales. The cumulative evidence suggests that rating scales are consistently just as reliable as the subjective probability scale. The probability scale contained significant method error. In fact, the two rating scales were found to have lower systematic method variance and lower random error variance than the subjective probability scale, The payer concludes with a discussion regarding possible explanations of these results and directions for future research.

J	Sueyoshi, T				Sueyoshi, T			Divestiture of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						telecommunications; natural monopoly; data envelopment analysis; regression analysis; goal programming; industrial policy	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL REGRESSION QUANTILE; BELL SYSTEM; COST FUNCTION; PROGRAMMING APPROACH; DEA; TELECOMMUNICATIONS; SUBADDITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY	This article discusses whether the Japanese government should break up NTT (Nippon Telegraph & Telephone) in 1995, as the U.S. federal government compelled AT&T (American Telephone & Telegram) to break itself into toll and local telephone companies in 1984. The divestiture of NTT has long been a major industrial policy issue in japan since the common carrier was privatized in 1985. The governmental decision to divest it may influence not only the Japanese telecommunications infrastructure, but also the global telecommunications and information industries in the world, where many common carriers are now facing an environmental change from regulation to competition. A unique feature of this study is that it employs eight different estimation techniques to obtain a cost function of NTT, so that this research avoids a methodological bias occurring in many empirical studies, This study confirms that NTT has maintained cost subadditivity, but it has failed to establish the status of a natural monopoly in the observed time period. However, it also finds that the NTT divestiture will not produce a price-reducing benefit to Japanese telecommunications consumers, This research result will. serve as empirical evidence for guiding the governmental review of this large-scale industrial policy issue in Japan.

J	Song, JS; Zipkin, PH				Song, JS; Zipkin, PH			The joint effect of leadtime variance and lot size in a parallel processing environment	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						(r,q) inventory model; stochastic leadtimes; heavy traffic approximation; lot size; leadtime variance	SYSTEMS	We study a basic (r, q) system, in which the demand is a Poisson process and the leadtimes are independent, identically-distributed random variables. The key issue is the joint effect of the leadtime variance and the lot she q on performance. We know that, under a simple base-stock policy (with q = 1), the leadtime variance has no effect at all. We find here that, for larger q, the leadtime variance can have a significant adverse impact on performance. To explore this effect, we test two simple approximations. The simplest ignores the leadtime variance. The second approach is only a bit more complex; it captures the variance effect through a hybrid of two limiting approximations. Both methods provide useful information, but the second is more robust.

J	Bitran, GR; Mondschein, SV				Bitran, GR; Mondschein, SV			Mailing decisions in the catalog sales industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						catalog sales; direct marketing; stochastic models; dynamic programming		Catalog sales are among the fastest growing businesses in the U.S. The most important asset a company in this industry has is its list of customers, called the house list. Building a house List is expensive, since the response rate of names from rental lists is low. Cash management therefore plays a central role in this capital intensive business, This paper studies optimal mailing policies in the catalog sales industry when there is limited access to capital, We consider a stochastic environment given by the random responses of customers and a dynamic evolution of the house list. Given the size of real problems, it is impossible to compute the optimal solutions. We therefore develop a heuristic based on the optimal solutions of simplified versions of the problem. The performance of this heuristic is evaluated by comparing its outcome with an upper bound derived for the original problem. Computational experiments show that it bt haves satisfactorily.

J	Abad, PL				Abad, PL			Optimal pricing and lot-sizing under conditions of perishability and partial backordering	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pricing; inventory control; perishable good; marketing/operations interface	DECISIONS	We formulate a generalized model of dynamic pricing and lot-sizing by a reseller who sells a perishable good. We assume that when it is economic to backlog demand, the reseller can plan for periods of shortage during which demand can be partially backordered. When the good is highly perishable, the reseller may need to backlog demand in order to market the good at a reasonable price. We present a simple solution procedure for solving the optimization problem. The procedure entails solving first a single nonlinear equation and then, if required, two nonlinear equations.

Consequently, when firms undertake a new (existing) product design (redesign) activity, it is important to employ techniques that will generate optimal solutions. As optimal product design using conjoint analysis data is an NP-hard problem, heuristic techniques for its solution have been proposed. This research proposes the use of and evaluates the performance of Genetic Algorithms (GA), which is based on the principles of natural selection, as an alternative procedure for generating ''good'' (i.e., close to optimal) solutions for the product design problem. The paper focuses on (1) how GA can be applied to the product design problems, (2) determining the comparative performance of GA vis-g-vis the dynamic programming (DP) heuristic (Kohli and Krishnamurti 1987, 1989) in generating solutions to the product design problems, (3) the sensitivity of the GA solutions to variations in parameter choices, and (4) generalizing the results of the dynamic programming heuristic to product designs involving attributes with varying number of levels and studying the impact of alternate attribute sequencing rules.

J	Magat, WA; Viscusi, WK; Huber, J				Magat, WA; Viscusi, WK; Huber, J			A reference lottery metric for valuing health	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						benefit valuation; health; utility	UTILITY; RISK	This study utilizes reference lotteries on life and death to establish a death-equivalent metric for valuing long-term health effects. We use a computer-based survey approach to elicit choices among residential locations that pose different risks of chronic disease and dying in an automobile accident. From paired choices between different locations, we infer their rates of trade-off between reducing the risks of chronic diseases and the automobile death risk. The values of reducing the risks from two diseases, a nerve disease (peripheral neuropathy) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system), are measured in terms of both trade-off rates with the risk of an automobile death and with dollars. While the use of reference lotteries for monetary outcomes to establish a utility metric is well established for monetary outcomes, our results suggest that reference lotteries on life and death can also be applied with decision-makers facing realistic choices to construct a utility metric for valuing health status. The results were corroborated by a strong positive correlation between the risk-risk trade-off values and relative aversion scores for the different health outcomes, as well as by the relative values of avoiding the three diseases in our study.

J	Wakker, P; Deneffe, D				Wakker, P; Deneffe, D			Eliciting von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities when probabilities are distorted or unknown	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						utility measurement; probability distortion; prospect theory; decision analysis; risk aversion; standard gamble	CHOQUET-EXPECTED UTILITY; DECISION-MAKING; PROSPECT-THEORY; LIFE YEARS; WEIGHTS; RISK; UNCERTAINTY; ATTRIBUTES; ADJUSTMENT; MODELS	This paper proposes a new method, the (gamble-)tradeoff method, for eliciting utilities in decision under risk or uncertainty. The elicitation of utilities, to be used in the expected utility criterion, turns out to be possible even if probabilities are ambiguous or unknown. A disadvantage of the tradeoff method is that a few more questions usually must be asked to clients. Also, the lotteries that are needed are somewhat more complex than in the certainty-equivalent method or in the probability-equivalent method. The major advantage of the tradeoff method is its robustness against probability distortions and misconceptions, which constitute a major cause of violations of expected utility and generate inconsistencies in utility elicitation. Thus the tradeoff method retains full validity under prospect theory, rank-dependent utility, and the combination of the two, i.e., cumulative prospect theory. The tradeoff method is tested for monetary outcomes and for outcomes describing life-duration. We find higher risk aversion for life duration, but the tradeoff method elicits similar curvature of utility. Apparently the higher risk aversion for Life duration is due to more pronounced deviations from expected utility.

J	Zavadlav, E; McClain, JO; Thomas, LJ				Zavadlav, E; McClain, JO; Thomas, LJ			Self-buffering, self-balancing, self-flushing production lines	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						work sharing; line balancing; low WIP; on-the-fly assignment; U-shaped	KANBAN	This research addresses a system of flexible worker assignments in a setting where there are more workers than machines. When organized using this system, a production line balances itself by shifting the workloads continuously and automatically in response to changes in the state of the system. The system is, in effect, buffering itself against variation by altering the work assignments on the fly. This allows the system to operate with very low levels of work-in-process inventory (WIP). In this paper, the workers (rather than machines) are the factor that limits the rate of output. We also assume that the line has a ''U'' shape, but many of the results do not depend on this topology. An industrial example is described. The system has some interesting and counter-intuitive properties which we demonstrate under a variety of circumstances through an exploratory approach that uses both Markovian and simulation models. Several different policies are compared under conditions of processing time uncertainty. We demonstrate that a flexible assignment system can outperform fixed assignments in a variety of circumstances. Of particular interest is the near absence of balance delay, even when the tasks cannot be divided equally among the workers.

This problem arises from the constant tug-of-war going on in manufacturing between efficient production and delivery performance, between maximizing machine utilization by batching similar jobs and maximizing customers' satisfaction by completing jobs before their due dates. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm, and our computational results show that it solves almost all instances with up to about 40 jobs to optimality. The main algorithmic contribution is our lower bounding strategy to deal with family setup times. The key idea is to see a setup time as a setup job with a specific processing time, release date, due date, and precedence relations. We develop several sufficient conditions to derive setup jobs. We specify their parameters and precedence relations such that the optimal solution value of the modified problem obtained by ignoring the setup times, not the setup jobs, is no larger than the optimal solution value of the original problem. One lower bound for the modified problem proceeds by allowing preemption. Due to the agreeable precedence structure, the preemptive problem is solvable in O(n log n) time.

J	Gable, GG				Gable, GG			A multidimensional model of client success when engaging external consultants	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						consultant engagement; management consultants; outsiders; advisors; management advisory services; management information systems; IS personnel resource management; management science success; MIS success; implementation success; package selection; outsourcing; service quality; knowledge-products; marketing intangibles	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESEARCH; USER-SATISFACTION; MIS SUCCESS; INVOLVEMENT	Too often the relationship between clients and external consultants is perceived as one of protagonist versus antagonist. Stories on dramatic, failed consultancies abound, as do related anecdotal quips. A contributing factor to many ''apparently'' failed consultancies is a poor appreciation by both the client and consultant of the client's hue goals for the project and how to assess progress toward these goals. This paper presents and analyses a measurement model for assessing client success when engaging an external consultant. Three main areas of assessment are identified: (1) the consultant's recommendations, (2) client learning, and (3) consultant performance. Engagement success is empirically measured along these dimensions through a series of case studies and a subsequent survey of clients and consultants involved in 85 computer-based information system selection projects. Validation of the model constructs suggests the existence of six distinct and individually important dimensions of engagement success. Both clients and consultants are encouraged to attend to these dimensions in pre-engagement proposal and selection processes, and post-engagement evaluation of outcomes.

J	Klassen, RD; McLaughlin, CP				Klassen, RD; McLaughlin, CP			The impact of environmental management on firm performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						financial performance; environmental awards; operations management; environmental performance	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; EVENT; RECALLS	Environmental management has the potential to play a pivotal role in the financial performance of the firm. Many individuals suggest that profitability is hurt by the higher production costs of environmental management initiatives, while others cite anecdotal evidence of increased profitability. A theoretical model is proposed that links strong environmental management to improved perceived future financial performance, as measured by stock market performance. The linkage to firm performance is tested empirically using financial event methodology and archival data of firm-level environmental and financial performance. Significant positive returns were measured for strong environmental management as indicated by environmental performance awards, and significant negative returns were measured for weak environmental management as indicated by environmental crises. The implicit financial market valuation of these events also was estimated. Cross-sectional analysis of the environmental award events revealed differences for first-time awards and between industries. First-time award announcements were associated with greater increases in market valuation, although smaller increases were observed for firms in environmentally dirty industries, possibly indicative of market skepticism. This linkage between environmental management and financial performance can be used by both researchers and practitioners as one measure of the benefits experienced by industry leaders, and as one criterion against which to measure investment alternatives.

By examining both international and domestic mergers, the present study assesses the relative role of national and corporate cultural fit in predicting effective integration between merger partners. The innovative, nonparametric co-plot method is introduced, and its main advantage - the simultaneous consideration of both variables and observations-is utilized to explore cultural fit in the two groups of mergers,The findings confirm that national and corporate culture are separate constructs with variable attitudinal and behavioral correlates.

J	Tushman, ML; Rosenkopf, L				Tushman, ML; Rosenkopf, L			Executive succession, strategic reorientation and performance growth: A longitudinal study in the US cement industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						succession; reorientation; organization learning; top management teams; turbulence	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL JOLTS; TURNOVER; DEMOGRAPHY; INERTIA; MODEL; TRANSFORMATION; INTEGRATION; OUTCOMES	This research explores the performance consequences of CEO succession, executive team change, and strategic reorientation in different contexts. Based on team demography and organization learning ideas, we argue that CEO succession or executive team change enhances incremental organization change, while either strategic reorientation or the combination of CEO succession with executive team change triggers discontinuous organization change. We hypothesize that these contrasting intervention modes are appropriate in different contexts. A longitudinal study of the U.S. cement industry from 1918-1986 demonstrates that simple CEO succession is positively associated with subsequent performance when context is stable, but significantly more negatively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. Executive team change has significant effects on organization adaptation in both stable and turbulent contexts. Strategic reorientations are negatively associated with subsequent performance in stable contexts, but significantly more positively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. As a set, these results reinforce a demographic approach to succession research and indicate that CEO succession, executive team change, and reorientation are each distinct and important levers shaping organization adaptation. The impacts of these levers are contingent on organization context.

J	Barton, RR; Ivey, JS				Barton, RR; Ivey, JS			Nelder-Mead simplex modifications for simulation optimization	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						experimental designs; stochastic optimization; direct-search techniques; discrete-event simulation	ANALYTICAL-CHEMISTRY; SOFTWARE	When the Nelder-Mead method is used to optimize the expected response of a stochastic system (e.g., an output of a discrete-event simulation model), the simplex-resizing steps of the method introduce risks of inappropriate termination. We give analytical and empirical results describing the performance of Nelder-Mead when it is applied to a response function that incorporates an additive white-noise error, and we use these results to develop new modifications of Nelder-Mead that yield improved estimates of the optimal expected response. Compared to Nelder-Mead, the best performance was obtained by a modified method, RS + S9, in which (a) the best point in the simplex is reevaluated at each shrink, step and (b) the simplex is reduced by 10% (rather than 50%) at each shrink step. In a suite of 18 test problems that were adapted from the MINPACK collection of NETLIB, the expected response at the estimated optimal Feint obtained by RS + S9 had errors that averaged 15% less than at the original method's estimated optimal point, at an average cost of three times as many function evaluations. Two well-known existing modifications for stochastic responses, the (n + 3)-rule and the next-to-worst rule, were found to be inferior to the new modification RS + S9.

J	Chang, CW; Chang, JSK				Chang, CW; Chang, JSK			Option pricing with stochastic volatility: Information-time vs calendar-time	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information-time; option pricing; random maturity; stochastic time change; stochastic volatility	FOREIGN-CURRENCY OPTIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS HYPOTHESIS; STOCK RETURNS; PRICES; MODELS; MIXTURE; TESTS; VALUATION; MARKET; VOLUME	Empirical evidence has shown that subordinated processes represent well the price changes of stocks and futures. Using either transaction counts or trading volume as a proxy for information arrival, it supports the contention that volatility is stochastic in calendar-time because of random information arrival, and thus becomes stationary in information-time. This contention has also been supported later in theoretical models. In this paper we investigate the implication of this contention to option pricing. First we price the option in calendar-time where the return of the underlying asset follows a jump subordinated process. We extend Rubinstein's (1976) and Ross's (1989a) martingale valuation methodology to incorporate the pricing of volatility risk. The resulting equilibrium formula requires estimating seven parameters upon implementation. We then make a stochastic time change, from calendar-time to information-time, in order to obtain a stationary underlying asset return process to price the option. We find that the isomorphic option has random maturity because the number of information arrivals prior to the option's calendar-time expiration date is random. We value the option using Dynkin's (1965) version of the Feynman-Kac formula that allows for a random terminal date. The resulting information-time formula requires estimating only one additional parameter compared to the Black-Scholes's in practical application. In this regard, the time change has reduced the computational complexity of the option pricing problem. Simulations show that the formula may outperform the Black-Scholes (1973) and Merton (1976a) models in pricing currency options. As a first attempt to derive valuation relationships in the information-time economy, this investigation may suggest that the information-time approach is a functional alternative to the current calendar-time norm. It is especially suitable for deriving ''volatility-free'' portfolio insurance strategies.

J	Hanson, W; Martin, K				Hanson, W; Martin, K			Optimizing multinomial logit profit functions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						optimization; logit; pricing; product line modeling	MODEL	The multinomial logit model is a standard approach for determining the probability of purchase in product line problems. When the purchase probabilities are multiplied by product contribution margins, the resulting profit function is generally nonconcave. Because of this, standard nonlinear search procedures may terminate at a local optimum which is far from the global optimum. We present a simple procedure designed to alleviate this problem. The key idea of this procedure is to find a ''path'' of prices from the global optimum of a related, but concave logit profit function, to the global optimum of the true (but nonconcave) logit profit function.

J	Walls, MR; Dyer, JS				Walls, MR; Dyer, JS			Risk propensity and firm performance: A study of the petroleum exploration industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						risk management; decision analysis; exponential utility; business strategy; firm performance; certainty equivalents; risk tolerance	DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; DECISION-ANALYSIS; RETURN; PARADOX; MARKET; OIL	This paper explores the differences in observed risk propensity among petroleum firms and their impact on firm performance. In this work, we (1) develop a decision theoretic model which measures a firm's risk propensity in the form of an ''implied'' utility function; (2) investigate changes in corporate risk propensity with respect to changes in firm size; and (3) examine the relationships between firms' risk propensities and alternative dimensions of economic performance, including ex post risk and return measures. We also develop a new risk propensity measure, the Risk Tolerance Ratio (RTR), which controls for firm size and allows firms to be differentiated in terms of relative risk propensity. The motivation for this work is managerial concerns regarding appropriate risk-laking behavior and the effect of risky choice on firm performance. This methodology has importance business strategy implications in that we are able to make strong inferences about causal relationships between ex ante risk-taking and performance. Our findings are compelling in that corporate risk propensity seems to matter, and that decisions about corporate risk policy have a significant impact on the petroleum firm's economic performance.

J	Hansen, JV; McDonald, JB; Messier, WF; Bell, TB				Hansen, JV; McDonald, JB; Messier, WF; Bell, TB			A generalized qualitative-response model and the analysis of management fraud	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auditing; management fraud; decision-making; generalized qualitative-response model	AUDITORS	Management fraud has become a topic of increasing interest to the public accounting profession. Prior research indicates that management fraud is seldom experienced by audiGtors. As a result, it is doubtful that auditors have a well-developed cognitive model for making fraud risk assessments as part of the audit planning process. Early research studies attempted to identify factors that could be linked to the occurrence of management fraud, while more recent work has attempted to build models to predict the presence of management fraud. In this paper, we report on a study that uses a powerful generalized qualitative-response model, EGB2 to model and predict management fraud based on a set of data developed by an international public accounting firm. The EGB2 specification includes the probit and logit models and others as special cases. Moreover, EGB2 easily accommodates asymmetric costs of type I and type II errors. This is important for public accounting firms since failure to predict fraud when it is present (a type II error) is usually very costly to the firm in terms of litigation. The results demonstrate good predictive capability for both symmetric and asymmetric cost assumptions.

This approximation uses only the first two moments of the probability distributions for the alternatives, and hence it can substantially reduce the amount of information which must be collected in order to evaluate alternatives when evaluation attributes are probabilistically dependent. The accuracy of the approximation is investigated by comparing results from using it with exact calculations for a variety of situations representative of those found in decision analysis practice. This investigation shows that the approximation is accurate for situations representative of many decision analysis applications, However, caution is needed in applying the approximation in some situations where it may give inaccurate results. Characteristics of cases where the approximation is less accurate are presented.

J	Hann, J; Weber, R				Hann, J; Weber, R			Information systems planning: A model and empirical tests	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information systems planning; agency theory; transaction-costs economics; contingency models of planning	TECHNOLOGY; IMPLEMENTATION; FIRM	Empirical studies of information systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan.

J	Brush, T; Karnani, A				Brush, T; Karnani, A			Impact of plant size and focus on productivity: An empirical study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						focussed factory; plant size; scale; plant focus; productivity; manufacturing strategy	SCALE; FLEXIBILITY	Recent popular business literature has suggested that there is a significant trend in the United States for firms to decrease the size and increase the focus of manufacturing plants they operate, and that this leads to higher productivity. This paper tests empirically the validity of these claims. We analyze data on virtually the entire population of manufacturing plants in the United States and find that, contrary to the popular business literature, the average size of plants increased during the period 1972-1984. However, consistent with the popular notion, the rate of growth in plant size slowed considerably, and even turned negative for a category of large plants. Plant focus did increase during this period. We then investigate the relationship between productivity and plant characteristics including plant size and plant focus. Overall, our results do not support the popular argument that reduction in plant size results in productivity gains. However, we do find support for this argument in some two-digit SIC industries; also, scale economies in the entire population decreased over the period 1972-1982. We also find only limited support for the popular argument that plant focus increases productivity.

In the present experiment, time series forecasts produced by neural networks are compared with forecasts from six statistical time series methods generated in a major forecasting competition (Makridakis et al. 1982); the traditional method forecasts were estimated by experts in the particular technique. The neural networks were estimated using the same ground rules as the competition. Across monthly and quarterly time series, the neural networks did significantly better than traditional methods. As suggested by theory, the neural networks were particularly effective for discontinuous time series.

J	Federgruen, A; Katalan, Z				Federgruen, A; Katalan, Z			The stochastic Economic Lot Scheduling Problem: Cyclical base-stock policies with idle times	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multi-item; stochastic inventory systems; single capacitated manufacturing facility; setup times	PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; POLLING SYSTEMS; SINGLE-MACHINE; WAITING TIME; MULTI-ITEM; SIZES; DEMANDS; QUEUE	In this paper we discuss stochastic Economic Lot Scheduling Problems (ELSP), i.e., settings where several items need to be produced in a common facility with limited capacity, under significant uncertainty regarding demands, production times, setup times, or combinations thereof. We propose a class of production/inventory strategies for stochastic ELSPs and describe how a strategy which minimizes holding, backlogging, and setup costs within this class can be effectively determined and evaluated. The proposed class of strategies is simple but rich and effective: when the facility is assigned to a given item, production continues until either a specific target inventory level is reached or a specific production batch has been completed; the different items are produced in a given sequence or rotation cycle, possibly with idle times inserted between the completion of an item's production batch and the setup for the next item. An optimal strategy within the class can be determined, and all relevant performance measures can be evaluated in just a few CPU seconds, using a 486-based PC. We also derive a number of easily computable lower bounds for the optimal cost value and establish a comparison with deterministic ELSPs.

The algorithm is based on a taboo search technique with a specific neighborhood definition which employs a critical path and blocks of operations notions. Computational experiments (up to 2,000 operations) show that the algorithm not only finds shorter makespans than the best approximation approaches but also runs in shorter time.

Each queue represents a class of jobs and possesses a holding cost rate, general service distribution, and general set-up time distribution. The objective is to minimize the expected holding cost due to the waiting of jobs. A set-up time is required to switch from one queue to another. We provide a limited characterization of the optimal policy and a simple heuristic scheduling policy for this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic over a wide range of problem instances.

J	Sun, MH; Stam, A; Steuer, RE				Sun, MH; Stam, A; Steuer, RE			Solving multiple objective programming problems using feed-forward artificial neural networks: The Interactive FFANN Procedure	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						multiple objective programming; feed-forward artificial neural networks; multiple criteria decision making; Analytic Hierarchy Process; interactive procedures	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING; UTILITY-THEORY; OPTIMIZATION; AHP; COMPUTATION; WEIGHTS	In this paper, we propose a new interactive procedure for solving multiple objective programming problems. Based upon feed-forward artificial neural networks (FFANNs), the method is called the Interactive FFANN Procedure. In the procedure, the decision maker articulates preference information over representative samples from the nondominated set either by assigning preference ''values'' to the sample solutions or by making pairwise comparisons in a fashion similar to that in the Analytic Hierarchy Process. With this information, a FFANN is trained to represent the decision maker's preference structure. Then, using the FFANN, an optimization problem is solved to search for improved solutions. An example is given to illustrate the Interactive FFANN Procedure. Also, the procedure is compared computationally with the Tchebycheff Method (Steuer and Choo 1983). The computational results indicate that the Interactive FFANN Procedure produces good solutions and is robust with regard to the neural network architecture.

J	Green, PE; Krieger, AM				Green, PE; Krieger, AM			Individualized hybrid models for conjoint analysis	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						conjoint analysis; computer simulation	COMPONENTIAL SEGMENTATION; PREDICTIVE POWER; DESIGN	Increasingly, conjoint analysts are being asked to design and analyze studies involving large numbers of attributes and/or attribute levels. Various types of approaches, including attribute bridging, Adaptive Conjoint Analysis, and hybrid models have been proposed to deal with the problem. This paper describes recent developments in hybrid modeling. Four hybrid models are described and compared in terms of their performance in an industry-based study entailing 15 product attributes. Comparisons are made in terms of internal cross-validation, market share estimates, attribute importances clustering, and its relationship to exogenous background variables. The proposed models are also compared to selected models from the transportation science literature. The authors emphasize the point that comparative model performance may strongly depend on the ways in which the models are to be used.

Here, we focus on a specific unexpected result of Umanath et al. who found evidence contradicting the theoretical prediction with respect to the impact of environmental uncertainty on the composition of compensation contracts. Umanath et al., in retrospect, offered an explanation for their unexpected finding based on an alternative theory under the saute agency framework. Our results not only ratify the alternative explanation offered by Umanath et al., but also identify information symmetry/asymmetry as the contingent factor capable of reconciling the apparently contradicting predictions of the two agency-based theories used in this research.

J	Park, SH; Russo, MV				Park, SH; Russo, MV			When competition eclipses cooperation: An event history analysis of joint venture failure	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						joint venture failure; cooperation between competitors; transaction-cost economics; event history analysis; nonmonotonic hazard	ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY; STRATEGIC ALLIANCE; TRANSACTION COSTS; UNITED-STATES; INTEGRATION; INNOVATION	Why do so many joint ventures fail? Despite the fact that their success is the exception rather than the rule, the literature on why joint venture performance has been so poor remains fragmentary. We address this issue, adopting a transaction-cost economics perspective and modeling joint ventures as governance structures that blend the advantages and drawbacks of both markets and hierarchies. Using a data base on electronics industry ventures and event history analysis, we identify several predictors of joint venture failure and test for their influences. A key finding is that the presence of competition between joint venture partners outside of the agreement significantly impairs chances for the operation's chance of survival. We also find clear evidence that the failure rate of joint ventures is nonmonotonic, rising to a peak in the middle term and then declining. Finally, we compare and contrast predictors of terminations due to failure to those due to acquisition of the joint venture by one of its partners. Our overall conclusions highlight implications for strategic choice theory-building and the management of joint ventures.

We report the use of simulation modeling as an approach to evaluate the outcomes of alternative designs prior to implementation. Mobile resources such as physicians with complex job descriptions and patients with time-varying arrival processes complicated the modeling task. A flexible, powerful simulation language helped to model resource decision rules and the frequent preemptions of less urgent activities as more urgent requests arise. A distribution fitting package enhanced the synthesis of data from diverse sources into distributions that adequately modeled input processes. The resulting simulation model was used to examine alternatives in the design of a new housestaff work schedule. We were able to predict accurately the effects on the sleep and activity profile of interns when their schedules were modified. Furthermore, this model has remained an asset for investigating consequences of many types of variation within the system, including changes in patient demand as well as numbers or job descriptions of the housestaff.

J	Harhoff, D				Harhoff, D			Strategic spillovers and incentives for research and development	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						innovation; knowledge spillovers; research and development	R-AND-D; MARKET-STRUCTURE; INNOVATION BENEFIT; COMPETITION; KNOWLEDGE; FIRMS; COST; APPROPRIABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; POLICY	This paper develops a model in which a monopolist supplier can contribute to downstream product improvements by creating knowledge spillovers which downstream firms use as a substitute for their own R&D efforts. Although a market for R&D information does not exist, the supplier may appropriate an indirect return on R&D for two reasons. Sufficiently high levels of spillover information lead to greater downstream product quality, and spillover information reduces the equilibrium sunk cost of R&D for downstream firms and thus facilitates entry. Both effects cause an expansion of downstream output and enhance the demand for the supplier's intermediate good. Given sufficiently strong incentives for supplier R&D, the locus of R&D shifts partially from the downstream to the upstream industry. R&D expenditures, technological opportunities, and downstream industry structure are determined endogenously. Weak appropriability conditions in the downstream industry enhance innovation incentives in the supply sector.

J	Joy, C; Boyle, PP; Tan, KS				Joy, C; Boyle, PP; Tan, KS			Quasi-Monte Carlo methods in numerical finance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; quasi-random sequences; Faure sequences; numerical finance; derivative valuation	QUASIRANDOM	This paper introduces and illustrates a new version of the Monte Carlo method that has attractive properties for the numerical valuation of derivatives. The traditional Monte Carlo method has proven to be a powerful and flexible tool for many types of derivatives calculations. Under the conventional approach pseudo-random numbers are used to evaluate the expression of interest. Unfortunately, the use of pseudo-random numbers yields an error bound that is probabilistic which can be a disadvantage. Another drawback of the standard approach is that many simulations may be required to obtain a high level of accuracy. There are several ways to improve the convergence of the standard method. This paper suggests a new approach which promises to be very useful for applications in finance. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods use sequences that are deterministic instead of random. These sequences improve convergence and give rise to deterministic error bounds. The method is explained and illustrated with several examples. These examples include complex derivatives such as basket options, Asian options, and energy swaps.

J	Ahn, JH; Hornberger, JC				Ahn, JH; Hornberger, JC			Involving patients in the cadaveric kidney transplant allocation process: A decision-theoretic perspective	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						kidney dialysis; kidney transplantation; decision analysis; action-timing problems	UNITED-STATES; ACCESS	The United Network for Organ Sharing system of allocating cadaveric kidneys for transplantation permits only minimal involvement of patients in the selection process. The system ignores potential variations in the importance that patients may attach to outcomes associated with the transplant decision. For instance, some patients may prefer only kidneys that will give them a very favorable chance to achieve a successful transplant. We designed a decision model in which patients are surveyed about their preferences for health states that in turn affect decisions about the type of donor kidneys that would be acceptable for transplantation. Our analyses show that patients with favorable transplant characteristics (e.g., young age, good health, good immunologic match between the donor kidney and the recipient) or who expect a minimal improvement in quality of life after successful transplantation can afford to be selective when considering which kidneys to accept for transplantation. Involving patients in selecting the optimal donor-kidney should improve patients' quality and duration of life with end-stage renal disease, and thereby improve the overall efficiency of the U.S. kidney transplantation program.

J	Pollack, H; Zeckhauser, R				Pollack, H; Zeckhauser, R			Budgets as dynamic gatekeepers	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						agency theory; budgeting; dynamic programming; gatekeeping; resource allocation; rationing	ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; DESIGN	Most large organizations allocate resources by means of fixed budgets: each subunit is normally entitled to spend a defined amount over a fixed period, usually one year. Fixed budgets create clear incentives for subunits to control costs. Yet such arrangements create major incentives for dynamic inefficiency, for example by encouraging subunits to exhaust their budgets toward the end of the fiscal year. This paper develops a dynamic optimization model to examine the incentives fostered by budget systems. It invokes the metaphor of physicians involved in a health care delivery system to examine incentives created by decentralized ''gatekeeping'' as a mechanism to control medical costs. The paper also discusses some methods to reduce the incentives for dynamic inefficiency that fixed budgets create.

J	Ho, TH; Weigelt, K				Ho, TH; Weigelt, K			Task complexity, equilibrium selection, and learning: An experimental study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						task complexity; equilibrium selection; learning, an experimental study	SIGNALING GAMES	We consider several coordination games with multiple equilibria each of which is a different division of a fixed pie. Laboratory experiments are conducted to address whether ''task complexity'' affects the selection of equilibrium by subjects. Three measures of task complexity-cardinality of choice space, level of iterative knowledge of rationality, and level of iterative knowledge of strategy-are manipulated and tested. Results suggest the three measures can predict choice behavior. Since strategically equivalent games can have different task complexity measures, our results imply that subjects are sensitive to game form presentation. We also fit data using three adaptive learning models: 1) Cournot, 2) Fictitious Play, and 3) Payoff Reinforcement, in increasing order of required cognitive effort. The Fictitious Play model, which tracks only cumulative frequencies of opponents' past behaviors fits the data best.

J	Mazzola, JB; McCardle, KF				Mazzola, JB; McCardle, KF			A Bayesian approach to managing learning-curve uncertainty	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						learning curve; stochastic learning; Bayesian analysis; dynamic programming model	OPTIMAL OUTPUT DECISIONS; EXPERIMENTATION; MODELS; FIRM	This paper introduces a Bayesian decision theoretic model of optimal production in the presence of learning-curve uncertainty. The well-known learning-curve model is extended to allow for random variation in the learning process with uncertainty regarding some parameter of the variation. A production run generates excess value (above its current revenue) for a Bayesian manager in two ways: it pushes the firm further along the learning curve, increasing the likelihood of lower costs for future runs; and it provides information, through the observed costs, that reduces the uncertainty regarding the rate at which costs are decreasing. We provide conditions under which one of the classical deterministic learning-curve results-namely, that optimal production exceeds the myopic level-carries over to the extended framework. We demonstrate that another classical deterministic learning-curve result-namely, that optimal production increases with cumulative production-does not hold in the Bayesian setting.

J	Damanpour, F				Damanpour, F			Organizational complexity and innovation: Developing and testing multiple contingency models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational innovation; structural complexity; organizational size; contingency model; meta-analysis	ADMINISTRATIVE INNOVATIONS; PRODUCT INNOVATION; ADOPTION; SIZE; ENVIRONMENTS; STRATEGY; CRITIQUE; PERFORMANCE; PERSPECTIVE; PROPOSAL	Current research in organizational innovation is extensive, yet, because of limitations in scope, most studies are not adequately encompassing. These studies typically relate organizational variables to innovation and control at most for the effect of one contingency factor. Because innovation depends upon a complex host of factors, such theories have limited predictive application. This study intends to develop and test theories that explain the variation in the organizational complexity-innovation relationship in greater detail. The study considers two major indicators of organizational complexity-structural complexity and organizational size. Hypotheses are proposed on the effects of 14 contingency factors on the relationships between structural complexity and innovation and organizational size and innovation. The contingency factors include environmental uncertainty, organizational size, industrial sectors, types of innovation, and stages of innovation adoption. Using a meta-analytic procedure for multivariate analysis, the hypotheses are then tested with data from published studies in organizational innovation during the last three decades. The effects of four methods variables-operational definitions of innovation, structural complexity and size, and similarity of data sources-are controlled for in testing the hypotheses. This process results in two powerful and encompassing models: (1) the association between structural complexity and innovation depends upon operational definition of complexity, environmental. uncertainty, use of manufacturing organizations, use of service organizations, focus on technical innovations, focus on product innovations, and focus on implementation of innovation; and (2) the association between organizational size and innovation depends upon operational definition of size, environmental uncertainty, use of service organizations, use of for-profit organizations, focus on technical innovations, and focus on product innovations. These models suggest avenues for further theory development and research, which we discuss.		Damanpour, F (reprint author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV, GRAD SCH MANAGEMENT, NEWARK, NJ 07102 USA.

J	Andradottir, S				Andradottir, S			Optimization of the transient and steady-state behavior of discrete event systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic optimization; simulation; stochastic approximation; gradient estimation; Robbins-Monro algorithm; regenerative method; likelihood ratio method; Markov chains; Harris recurrence	RECURRENT MARKOV-CHAINS; STOCHASTIC-APPROXIMATION; CONVERGENCE; SIMULATION; QUEUE; ALGORITHMS	We present a general framework for applying simulation to optimize the behavior of discrete event systems. Our approach involves modeling the discrete event system under study as a general state space Markov chain whose distribution depends on the decision parameters. We then show how simulation and the likelihood ratio method can be used to evaluate the performance measure of interest and its gradient, and we present conditions that guarantee that the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation algorithm will converge almost surely to the optimal values of the decision parameters. Both transient and steady-state performance measures are considered. For steady-state performance measures, we consider both the case when the Markov chain of interest is regenerative in the standard sense, as well as the case when this Markov chain is Harris recurrent, and thereby regenerative in a wider sense.

J	Tempelmeier, H; Derstroff, M				Tempelmeier, H; Derstroff, M			A Lagrangean-based heuristic for dynamic multilevel multiitem constrained lotsizing with setup times	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						production planning; MRP; capacity constraints; multilevel lotsizing; setup times	LOT-SIZING PROBLEM; RELAXATION; SYSTEMS; REQUIREMENTS	In this paper a heuristic approach for the dynamic multilevel multiitem lotsizing problem in general product structures with multiple constrained resources and setup times is proposed. With the help of Lagrangean relaxation the capacitated multilevel multiitem lotsizing problem is decomposed into several uncapacitated single-item lotsizing problems. From the solutions of these single-item problems lower bounds on the minimum objective function value are derived. Upper bounds are generated by means of a heuristic finite scheduling procedure. The quality of the approach is tested with reference to various problem groups of differing sizes.

J	Collopy, F				Collopy, F			Biases in retrospective self-reports of time use: An empirical study of computer users	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						end-user computing; information systems; managerial computing; research methods; response bias; system monitors; system usage; time study	INFORMATION-SYSTEM USE; ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH; ELECTRONIC MAIL; NETWORK DATA; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; CATEGORIES; ACCURACY; VALIDITY; MODEL	Research on information systems (IS) use has often relied upon retrospective self-reports. One example is when the amount of time spent using a system is reported, often as an indication of user acceptance. In this study, self-assessments of computer usage are compared with computer-monitored interactive use and conned time for 401 managers and professionals. When self-assessed use was compared with logged interactive use, there was a 32% difference in the average amount of use (3.9 vs. 2.7 hours/day). When the self-assessment was compared with total conned time, the averages were similar to each other (3.9 vs. 4.0 hours). In both comparisons, though, there were considerable differences between individual self-assessments and logged time (with a median absolute percentage difference of 47% when compared with logged connect time). Individual estimates of use tended to regress toward the population's mean use. Those whose use of the system was relatively light overestimated their use, while heavy users underestimated theirs. When a test of the relationship between user satisfaction and amount of use was conducted using self-assessments, the relationship was not statistically significant. When the same test was conducted using logged connect time, the relationship was significant. These results suggest that fare should be exercised in operationalizing the user acceptance construct through self-reports of time use.

Using formal system models from queueing theory, this paper explores the conditions under which such radical changes in system structure are likely to be appropriate. In general, a fairly high degree of variability in task times seems to be necessary.		Buzacott, JA (reprint author), YORK UNIV,SCHULICH SCH BUSINESS,N YORK,ON M3J 1P3,CANADA.

To optimize the expected performance of such systems as a function of several continuous input parameters (decision variables), we present a ''scaled'' stochastic approximation algorithm for finding the zero (root) of the gradient of the response function. In each iteration of the scaled algorithm, two independent gradient estimates are sampled at the current estimate of the optimal input-parameter vector to compute a scale-free estimate of the next search direction. We establish sufficient conditions to ensure strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator of the optimal input-parameter vector. Strong consistency is also established for a variant of the scaled algorithm with Kesten's acceleration. An experimental performance comparison of the scaled algorithm and the classical Robbins-Monro algorithm in two simple queueing systems reveals some of the practical advantages of the scaled algorithm.

J	Kim, WC; Mauborgne, RA				Kim, WC; Mauborgne, RA			Procedural justice and managers' in-role and extra-role behavior: The case of the multinational	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						procedural justice; in-role behavior; extra-role behavior; strategic decision making; multinational management; strategy execution	ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; CITIZENSHIP; STRATEGIES; DECISIONS	Existing procedural justice studies to date offer only pieces of the picture on how procedural justice judgments affect behavior. Besides, these studies have been conducted primarily in the legal context. This paper develops a comprehensive picture of how procedural justice affects managers' in-role and extra-role behavior in the business context. It does so by examining the direct and indirect effects of procedural justice judgments on the in-role and extra-role behavior of multinationals' subsidiary top management in the context of the global resource allocation decision process. Especially, this paper advances and tests a theory which predicts that the attitude of commitment to support decisions provides a bridge between procedural justice and extra-role behavior. Based on an analysis of 119 subsidiary top managers, we offer evidence in support of this theory. Besides its contribution to the procedural justice literature, our study also sheds light on one of the most pressing issues outstanding in the field of international management: how multinationals can motivate subsidiary top managers to implement their global resource allocation decisions. The results suggest that the exercise of procedural justice inspires managers to go beyond the call of duty and engage in innovative actions, spontaneous cooperation, and creative behavior on behalf of the organization in their execution of decisions.

J	Azaiez, MN; Bier, VM				Azaiez, MN; Bier, VM			Aggregation error in Bayesian analysis of reliability systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian estimation; perfect aggregation; aggregation error	PERFECT AGGREGATION	Perfect aggregation in Bayesian system reliability analysis has been shown to be extremely unlikely. In other words, aggregation error is almost inevitable. Consequently, analysts have to deal with the following dilemma: on one hand, an aggregate analysis (i.e., an analysis at the system level), while relatively inexpensive, may be misleading. On the other hand, a disaggregate analysis (i.e., at the component level) provides more accurate results, but may be costly and impractical. Therefore, simple techniques to estimate the size of aggregation error are necessary to help analysts choose the most appropriate level of detail for an analysis. In this paper, reasonable bounds on the aggregation error are derived for a variety of reliability models. Ln particular, these bounds will never be more than twice the actual error. Tools to compute these bounds (and in some cases the actual error) are also provided.		Azaiez, MN (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT IND ENGN,1513 UNIV AVE,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.

J	Greenleaf, EA; Sinha, AR				Greenleaf, EA; Sinha, AR			Combining buy-in penalties with commissions at auction houses	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						auctions; bidding; commissions; pricing; penalty		Most auction sellers consign property to auction houses rather than holding the auction themselves. In addition to charging sellers a commission on property that sells in the auction, many auction houses also specify buy-in penalties in auction contracts. This is an amount the seller must pay the auction house if the property fails to sell at auction. An important managerial question for auction houses is whether and when buy-in penalties can increase revenues of the auction house, seller, or both, and what combinations of commission and buy-in penalty to use. We show that auctions which combine buy-in penalties with lower commissions Pareto-dominate auctions that use only commissions. This strategy motivates the seller to set a lower reserve, which creates a surplus in auction revenues that can go to one or both parties. This strategy is Pareto-dominant even if the auction house and the seller are uncertain about the number of bidders at the auction, or the auction house is uncertain about the seller's own valuation for the property, at the time the buy-in penalty, commission, and reserve are contractually set.

Firm-level evidence on the returns to information systems spending	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information technology; productivity; production function; computers; software; IS budgets		The ''productivity paradox'' of information systems (IS) is that, despite enormous improvements in the underlying technology, the benefits of IS spending have not been found in aggregate output statistics. One explanation is that IS spending may lead to increases in product quality or variety which tend to be overlooked in the aggregate statistics, even if they increase output at the firm-level. Furthermore, the restructuring and cost-cutting that are often necessary to realize the potential benefits of IS have only recently been undertaken in many firms. Our study uses new firm-level data on several components of IS spending for 1987-1991. The dataset includes 367 large firms which generated approximately 1.8 trillion dollars in output in 1992. We supplemented the IS data with data on other inputs, output, and price deflators from other sources. As a result, we could assess several econometric models of the contribution of IS to firm-level productivity. Our results indicate that IS spending has made a substantial and statistically significant contribution to firm output. We find that the gross marginal product (MP) for computer capital averaged 81% for the firms in our sample. We find that the MP for computer capital is at least as large as the marginal product of other types of capital investment and that, dollar for dollar, IS labor spending generates at least as much output as spending on non-IS labor and expenses. Because the models we applied were similar to those that have been previously used to assess the contribution of IS and other factors of production, we attribute the different results to the fact that our data set is more current and larger than others explored. We conclude that the productivity paradox disappeared by 1991, at least in our sample of firms.

J	Gallagher, MA; Bauer, KW; Maybeck, PS				Gallagher, MA; Bauer, KW; Maybeck, PS			Initial data truncation for univariate output of discrete-event simulations using the Kalman filter	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						output analysis; initial transient; truncation; Kalman filter; multiple model adaptive estimation	STARTUP PROBLEM; STEADY-STATE	Data truncation is a commonly accepted method of dealing with initialization bias in discrete-event simulation. An algorithm for determining the appropriate initial-data truncation point for univariate output is proposed. The technique entails averaging across independent replications and estimating a steady-state output model in a state-space framework. A Bayesian technique called Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) is applied to compute a time varying estimate of the output's steady-state mean. This MMAE implementation features the use, in parallel, of a bank of three Kalman filters. Each filter is constructed under a different assumption about the output's steady-state mean. One of the filters assumes that the steady-state mean is accurately reflected by an estimate, called the ''assumed steady-state mean,'' taken from the last half of the simulation data. This filter is called the reference filter. The remaining filters are calibrated with steady-state means corresponding to simple functions of the minimum and maximum data values, respectively. As the filters process the output through the effective transient, the reference filter becomes more likely (in a Bayesian sense) to be the best filter to represent the data, and the MMAE mean estimator is influenced increasingly towards the assumed steady-state mean. The estimated truncation point is selected when the MMAE mean estimate is within a small tolerance of the assumed steady-state mean. A Monte Carlo analysis using data generated from twelve simulation models is used to evaluate the technique. The evaluation criteria include the ability to estimate accurately and to construct reliable confidence intervals for the mean of the response based on the truncated sequences.

J	Desruelle, P; Steudel, HJ				Desruelle, P; Steudel, HJ			A queuing network model of a single-operator manufacturing workcell with machine/operator interference	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queueing network model; manufacturing workcell; machine/operator interference	MEAN-VALUE ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS	We present an analytical approach to evaluate the performance of a manufacturing workcell tended by a single operator when operator-induced machine interference occurs. Each part must be processed at every workstation in the workcell. The fact that one or more machines can request an operator service while the operator is busy at another machine induces machine interference. If the reduction of the workcell's capacity due to this interference becomes too great, then the customer demand may not be satisfied. Our approach determines quickly whether the workcell can meet a required demand under its current configuration and operating parameters. We do this by modeling the workcell as two interacting queuing networks: an open part/machine network, and a closed machine/operator network. In the open network, parts arrive in batches of a fixed size for each part type, but with exponentially distributed interarrival times between parts. In both networks, service times follow general distributions that are characterized by their first two moments.

J	Aykin, T				Aykin, T			Optimal shift scheduling with multiple break windows	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						manpower scheduling; service operations management; integer programming	OPERATOR	This paper presents a new integer programming model for optimal shift scheduling with multiple rest and lunch breaks, and break windows. A set-covering approach for this problem was originally developed by Dantzig (1954). Since then, a number of set-covering-based formulations have been proposed in the literature. These formulations require an integer variable for every shift type, shift start time, and rest/lunch break placement combination. Unfortunately, the number of integer variables required is rather large, making them impractical to solve for an optimal solution in most applications. We present a new approach in which a set of break variables is introduced for every shift-break type combination to determine the break placements. This approach leads to a significantly improved integer programming model requiring substantially smaller number of variables and computer memory. We tested the proposed approach with 40 test problems involving between 1,728 and 8,640 shift variations, and five demand patterns. Our results showed that the proposed formulation is very useful in solving large shift scheduling problems optimally.

J	Schmidt, RL				Schmidt, RL			A stochastic optimization model to improve production planning and R&D resource allocation in biopharmaceutical production processes	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						biotechnology/bioprocess engineering; production planning; research and development; stochastic optimization	MAMMALIAN-CELL CULTURE; ANIMAL-CELL	The increasing cost of health care has brought pressure to reduce pharmaceutical costs, and because manufacturing and R&D are significant cost factors, these areas have been targeted as potential sources of cost reduction. Manufacturing costs are particularly high in the biotechnology industry because process technologies are relatively new. Contamination, genetic instability, and other factors complicate production planning and make bioprocess systems unreliable. This paper presents a Markov decision process model that combines features of engineering design models and aggregate production planning models to obtain a hybrid model that links biological and engineering parameters to optimize operations performance. Using tissue plasminogen activator as a specific example, the paper shows how the hybrid modeling approach not only improves production planning, but also provides accurate information on the operating performance of bioprocesses that can be used to predict the financial impact of process changes. Therefore, the model can be used to guide investments in manufacturing process improvement and R&D (e.g., genetic modifications). Although stochastic production models are not commonly used in process design, this paper shows how a combined engineering production model can facilitate a concurrent design approach to reduce cost in bioprocess development.

A driver who needs to fill his tank sees the queue situation at the first station but not at the second one. The driver estimates the expected waiting time at the first station, compares it to the conditional expected waiting time at the second one, and decides which station to enter. The second station is assumed to be on the driver's route so that no extra cost is involved in choosing it.

J	Nault, BR				Nault, BR			Equivalence of taxes and subsidies in the control of production externalities	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						public policy; externalities; taxes; subsidies; environmental policy; social welfare; production technology	ECONOMICS	We are always better off having many policies that can achieve a given objective because it extends the criteria that can be included in policy selection. This paper studies the equivalence between taxes and subsidies in the control of negative production externalities. In our models, under the tax regime, firms that take no treatment action to mitigate the damage caused by their negative externalities are punished, whereas under the subsidy regime, firms are rewarded for externality treatment activities. We employ a formulation where firms differ in the vintage of their production technology and as a result differ in profitability, negative externality generation, and the cost of treatment. We consider three measures as policy objectives: total output, total damage from negative externalities, and social welfare. We find reasonable conditions where, with an appropriate setting of uniform lump-sum and unit subsidies, the policy maker can achieve a pair of policy objectives equivalent to those obtained using unit taxes. Thus, either tax or subsidy regimes can be used to achieve desired levels of one or two policy objectives, allowing other factors such as fairness, equity, or international trade issues to be considered in policy selection.

J	Gerchak, Y; Gupta, D; Henig, M				Gerchak, Y; Gupta, D; Henig, M			Reservation planning for elective surgery under uncertain demand for emergency surgery	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						health care; hospitals; dynamic programming; applications; probability; stochastic model applications	WAITING LISTS; YIELD	This work concerns the advance scheduling of elective surgery when the operating rooms' capacity utilization by emergency surgery, as well as by elective procedures, is uncertain. New requests for bookings of elective surgery arrive each day. Such procedures preferably would be performed as soon as possible, but admitting too many patients may result in exceeding a day's capacity, possibly necessitating turning away some emergency cases. So the problem facing the hospital at the start of each day is how many of the additional requests for elective surgery to assign for that day. We provide a stochastic dynamic programming model for this aggregate advance scheduling problem. The model has some novel mathematical features. We analyze it and characterize the nature of the optimal policy, which is not necessarily of a control-limit type. Plausible numerical examples which confirm our theoretical results and provide additional insights are reported.

This article shows how it is possible to visualize such data and to detect cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies in the respondent's judgments. The graphical method used to display preferences is not new in itself: it dates back at least to the work of Gower (1977), and many variants of his technique can be found in the literature. But Gower plots provide an especially valuable diagnostic tool in the context of AHP, as discussed and abundantly illustrated herein.

Using data from the International Motor Vehicle Program (M.I.T.) study of 70 assembly plants worldwide, the paper examines three dimensions of product variety, at fundamental, peripheral, and intermediate levels. The international sample reveals great variation in the distribution of each type of product variety in different regions, reflecting in part different: strategies for variety. Furthermore, the impact of different kinds of product variety on performance varies, and is generally much less than the conventional manufacturing wisdom would predict. However, an intermediate type of product variety, here called parts complexity, was found to have a persistent negative impact on produc tivity. Finally, the study provides partial support for the hypothesis that management policies, in both operations and human resource areas, can facilitate the absorption of higher levels of product variety, i.e. that ''lean production'' plants are capable of handling higher levels of product variety with less adverse effect on total labor productivity than traditional ''mass production'' plants.

J	Pasa, M; Shugan, SM				Pasa, M; Shugan, SM			The value of marketing expertise	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing; value; expertise; decision analysis	ADVANTAGE; CHANNEL; ISSUES; MODEL	This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the Value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression far the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise. For example, greater market instability and market presence increase the value of marketing expertise, while larger organization size, organization instability, and competition decrease its value.

The antecedents are causal understanding; innovation team proficiency; emergence and mobilization of new competences; and creation of competitive advantages, each of which are conceptually distinct and precisely defined in the paper. These constructs are linked together in a stage model and subsequently operationalized and tested using LISREL. Substantial support is found for the central thesis, that achieving each of the four antecedent processes increases the predicted rents from an innovation project.

J	Wirl, F				Wirl, F			The design of optimal conservation programs by electric utilities considering strategic consumer behavior	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						demand-side-management; strategic reactions; moral hazard; optimal mechanism design	ENERGY	The practice of utility demand side conservation programs, one of the most topical issues of utility management, provokes strategic reactions of consumers. As a solution to this moral. hazard, optimal conservation programs are characterized when the consumers differ either with respect to their subjective time preference or with respect to the level oi dem;ind. In particular, we derive incentive compatible conservation schemes that mitigate strategic behavior. These incentives differ starkly from actual programs. First, the costs of conservation may exceed the avoided costs, yet accepting such high costs (at the margin) need not imply a large conservation. Second, such incentive scheme should bypass the inefficient consumers (e.g., the ''poor'') bu; should instead target consumers who act efficiently and have a high demand (e.g., the ''rich'').

J	Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR				Hendricks, KB; Singhal, VR			Quality awards and the market value of the firm: An empirical investigation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Total Quality Management; TQM; quality awards; stock market reaction; event study	DAILY STOCK RETURNS; EVENT; METHODOLOGIES; MODEL; RISK	This paper empirically investigates the impact of winning a quality award on the market value of firms by estimating the mean ''abnormal'' change in the stock prices of a sample of firms on the date when information about winning a quality award was publicly announced. We note that the abnormal returns generated by the quality award winning announcements provide a lower bound for the impact of implementing an effective quality improvement program. Our results show that the stock market reacts positively to quality award announcements. Statistically significant mean abnormal returns on the day of the announcements ranged from a low of 0.59% to a high of 0.67% depending on the model used to generate the abnormal returns. The reaction was particularly strong for smaller firms (mean abnormal returns ranged from low of 1.16% to a high of 1.26%), and for firms that won awards from independent organizations such as Malcolm Baldrige, Philip Crosby, etc. (mean abnormal returns ranged from a low of 1.31% to a high of 1.65%). Winning a quality award also conveys information about the systematic risk of the firm. We find a statistically significant decrease in the equity and the asset betas after the quality award announcement. There is also evidence to suggest that large firms experience negative stock price performance in the second year before winning quality awards, which is followed by a year of positive performance. Small firms experience a positive stock price performance in the second year before winning quality awards but no negative performance before winning quality awards.

J	Srinivasan, MM; Gupta, D				Srinivasan, MM; Gupta, D			When should a roving server be patient?	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						polling systems; patient server mechanism; production-cyclic	SYSTEMS; SERVICE; QUEUES; TIMES	When polling systems are used to model real-world systems, it is typically assumed that the server switches continuously (''roves'') even when there are no waiting jobs in the system. However, requiring the server to be patient, instead of having it rove, might be more realistic. Furthermore, operational control of these systems can be improved by knowing answers to questions like ''under what circumstances should a roving server be patient?'' and ''at which stations?'' This paper analyzes the patient server model and provides explicit expressions for the waiting time distributions, the mean waiting times and the pseudo-conservation law. Several variants of the patient server model are considered. We show that while the patient server mechanism is generally better than the roving server mechanism in the work-in-process (WIP) reduction sense, there do exist cases where roving is better. Counter-intuitive examples where reducing switchover time can increase WIP are also reported.

J	Wilson, JG				Wilson, JG			Note on variance reducing group maintenance policies	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						production; machines; maintenance; scheduling	REPLACEMENT; SYSTEM	Group replacement policies for machines operating in parallel are generally evaluated by computing the associated expected cost per unit tine. However; as with all stochastically evolving systems, variance should play an important managerial role. Mo matter which policy is used by the maintenance manager, knowledge of the associated variance provides important information about the variability of the costs that will be incurred by using this policy. Additionally, there will be cases where a decision maker is willing to incur increased expected cost per unit time in order to reduce the variability of the costs among cycles. This paper demonstrates that it is feasible and practicable to calculate the variance of the cost per unit time associated with group maintenance policies.

J	Bogetoft, P				Bogetoft, P			DEA on relaxed convexity assumptions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); convex isoquants; minimal extrapolation; mathematical programming	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING UNITS; EFFICIENCY	In a recent paper, Petersen (1990) proposed to relax the convexity assumptions invoked in traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Unfortunately, the new approach is not consistent with the relaxed assumptions. Also, the efficiency evaluations in input and output spaces are based on different technological assumptions. The aim of this paper is to clarify which assumptions are actually involved and to develop modifications such that the input and output based measures are consistent. In effect, a family of DEA methods based on relaxed convexity assumptions is identified.		Bogetoft, P (reprint author), COPENHAGEN SCH ECON & BUSINESS ADM,DASY,COPENHAGEN,DENMARK.

The program evaluation procedure distinguishes between managerial and programmatic inefficiency and uses the Mann-Whitney rank statistic to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences observed between a treatment program and its control group program after adjusting for differences in managerial efficiency between the programs. A numerical example, based on the data used to evaluate the educational enhancement of the Program Follow Through, is used to illustrate the proposed statistical procedures.

J	Rhee, BD				Rhee, BD			Consumer heterogeneity and strategic quality decisions	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						consumer heterogeneity; quality; unobservable attributes; logit; two-stage game; quality differentiation; unique versus identical qualities	PRICE-COMPETITION; PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION; EXISTENCE; EQUILIBRIA; MODELS; LOGIT	Though recent studies show that quality differentiation is an equilibrium outcome, products of similar qualities frequently are observed in the marketplace. This inconsistency may be explained by incorporating consumer heterogeneity along unobservable attributes into a model of competition. In this paper, consumers not only take into account the quality and price of a product but also their heterogeneous tastes along other attributes which are unobservable to firms. We investigate the effect of heterogeneity along the unobservable attributes on both quality and price equilibrium in a two-stage game framework. We show that when consumers are sufficiently heterogeneous along the unobservable attributes, the firms offer products of identical qualities in equilibrium. Under low levels of heterogeneity along the unobservable attributes, however, our results are consistent with past research which argues for quality differentiation.

J	Cohen, MA; Eliashberg, J; Ho, TH				Cohen, MA; Eliashberg, J; Ho, TH			New product development: The performance and time-to-market tradeoff	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						new product development; time-to-market; new product performance	QUALITY; ENTRY; MODEL	Reduction of new product development cycle time and improvements in product performance have become strategic objectives for many technology-driven firms. These goals may conflict, however, and firms must explicitly consider the tradeoff between them. In this paper we introduce a multistage model of new product development process which captures this trade-off explicitly. We show that if product improvements are additive (over stages), it is optimal to allocate maximal time to the most productive development stage. We then indicate how optimal time-to-market and its implied product performance targets vary with exogenous factors such as the size of the potential market, the presence of existing and new products, profit margins, the length of the window of opportunity, the firm's speed of product improvement, and competitor product performance. We show that some new product development metrics employed in practice, such as minimizing break-even time, can be sub-optimal if firms are striving to maximize profits. We also determine the minimal speed of product improvement required for profitably undertaking new product development, and discuss the implications of product replacement which can occur whenever firms introduce successive generations of new products. Finally, we show that an improvement in the speed of product development does not necessarily lead to an earlier time-to-market, but always leads to enhanced products.

The study analyzed data from over 100 North American business organizations. Results indicate that organizations with effective scanning systems tend to align their scanning designs with the requirements of their context. On the other hand, the results show that organizations with ineffective scanning systems typically fail to exhibit the requisite level of alignment between contexts and scanning design.

This paper is concerned with development of indicators to determine whether or not the specification of the input and output space is supported by data in the sense that the variation in data is sufficient for estimation of a frontier of the same dimension as the input output space. Insufficient variation in data implies that some inputs/outputs can be substituted along the efficient frontier but only in fixed proportions. Data thus locally supports variation in a subspace of a lower dimension rather than in the input output space of full dimension. Each segment of the efficient frontier is in this sense subject to local collinearity. Insufficient variation in data provides a bound on admissible disaggregations in cases where substitution in fixed proportions is incompatible with a priori information concerning the production process. A data set incapable of estimating a frontier of full dimension will in this case be denoted ill-conditioned. It is shown that the existence of well-defined marginal rates of substitution along the estimated strongly efficient frontier segments requires the existence of Full Dimensional Efficient Facets (FDEFs). A test for the existence of FDEFs is developed, and an operational two-stage procedure for efficiency evaluation relative to an overall non-fixed technology is developed; the two-stage procedure provides a lower and an upper bound on the efficiency index for each DMU.

We analyze the performance of posted pricing for transactions having significant common-value elements. In a model of two-sided private information, we characterize the fully revealing, perfect equilibrium offer strategy of the seller. We also characterize equilibrium behavior under two other pricing procedures-a sealed-bid procedure and a direct revelation mechanism. Finally, we examine the efficiency of these procedures and show that as the degree of common values increases, fewer mutually beneficial agreements are attained.

J	Bhoovaraghavan, S; Vasudevan, A; Chandran, R				Bhoovaraghavan, S; Vasudevan, A; Chandran, R			Resolving the process vs product innovation dilemma: A consumer choice theoretic approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						process-product innovation; choice theory; US-Japanese competitiveness; integrated R&D strategy	ELIMINATION; MODEL	There has been considerable emphasis on the strategic importance of process and product innovation in the management literature. What actually constitutes process and product innovation, however, is a confused issue in the current literature. Are product and process innovations separate, or are they on a continuum? The importance of addressing this issue is that research over the past few decades has attributed Japan's increasing competitiveness to its propensity to process innovate. This paper uses a consumer-based approach to distinguish between process and product innovation using a model based on choice theory. An empirical illustration of the model is also presented. The model is then used to emphasize the need to pursue an integrated strategy of process and product innovation in response to consumer wants. The model also helps managers decide on the appropriate mix of process innovation relative to product innovation for R&D resource allocation purposes.

J	Balachandran, BV; Ramakrishnan, RTS				Balachandran, BV; Ramakrishnan, RTS			Joint cost allocation for multiple lots	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						cost allocation; stability; core solutions; dual methods		We consider the joint cost allocation problem that arises when several lots or resources are available to serve different products or divisions. We provide a two-phase model, wherein the first phase the optimal set of lots to be acquired is chosen and given the optimal set, and the products using each acquired lot is also determined. In the second phase, a stable full cost allocation method is developed that will not induce the divisions to form coalitions to reduce the allocated joint costs. Utilizing the optimal dual solution of the lot selection phase, we provide a joint cost allocation mechanism based on the concept of propensity to contribute and show that this allocation is also stable. If in the first phase there is a dual gap, then we show that there is no cost allocation in the core. A numerical illustration is provided.

J	Rubio, R; Wein, LM				Rubio, R; Wein, LM			Setting base stock levels using product-form queueing networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						production/inventory systems; queueing networks	QUEUING NETWORK; KANBAN; MODELS	A manufacturing facility produces multiple products in a make-to-stock manner, and unsatisfied demand is backordered. A simple production control policy is analyzed: When the amount of work-in-process inventory plus finished goods inventory for a particular product falls below a base stock level, then release another unit of that product onto the shop floor. Assuming that the work-in-process inventory has a steady state distribution and that there are different costs incurred for carrying in-process, completed and backordered units, we show that the cost minimizing base stock level for each product is a critical fractile of the steady state distribution of the product's total work-in-process inventory. By exploiting the relationship between the make-to-stock system and an open queueing network, we identify specific formulas for the base stock levels under standard product-form assumptions. For the lost sales case, a similar relation to a closed queueing network can be used to characterize the optimal control parameters.

J	Broadie, M; Glasserman, P				Broadie, M; Glasserman, P			Estimating security price derivatives using simulation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; derivative estimation; security pricing; option pricing	STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; OPTIONS; VALUATION; AVERAGE	Simulation has proved to be a valuable tool for estimating security prices for which simple closed form solutions do not exist. In this paper we present two direct methods, a pathwise method and a likelihood ratio method, for estimating derivatives of security prices using simulation. With the direct methods, the information from a single simulation can be used to estimate multiple derivatives along with a security's price. The main advantage of the direct methods over resimulation is increased computational speed. Another advantage is that the direct methods give unbiased estimates of derivatives, whereas the estimates obtained by resimulation are biased. Computational results are given for both direct methods, and comparisons are made to the standard method of resimulation to estimate derivatives. The methods are illustrated for a path independent model (European options), a path dependent model (Asian options), and a model with multiple state variables (options with stochastic volatility).

Both situations are modelled as coalitional games, and game theoretic techniques are used to tackle the problems. It is shown that a special class of coalitional games emerges from the situations under consideration and that the structure of the situations has theoretical implications, including the coincidence of several game theoretic solution concepts. The implications of these theoretical results for the two practical problems are discussed.

For the model we assume that each site in the system orders at preset times according to an order-up-to policy, that delivery times are deterministic, and that the demand processes are stochastic with independent increments. We introduce a new scheme for allocating stock in short supply, which we call virtual allocation and which permits significant tractability. We exercise the model on a set of test problems for two-echelon systems to get insight into the structure of good policies. The primary findings are that both the central warehouse (upper echelon) and the retail sites (lower echelon) should hold safety stock, but that most of the safety stock should be at the retail sites.

This procedure, the Coefficient Modification Heuristic (CMH), exploits a special problem structure by solving repetitively a small linear programming restriction of the original problem. The key idea is to modify the constraint coefficients of certain variables in the LP restriction to implicitly account for the capacity consumed in setups. We compare the performance of the CMH with the commercial code, Optimization System Library (OSL), on three families of test problems. The first set is a collection of small-scale random problems that are solved to optimality to provide known benchmarks. The second is a set of problems based on a real printed circuit board manufacturing situation. The third group is a set of medium-scale randomly generated problems based on the underlying structure of the printed circuit board set. Overall, the CMH found solutions that averaged 18% better than time constrained OSL runs in a small fraction of the corresponding CPU times.

A general framework is given. Bounds on the loss of optimality arising from two planning horizon decision processes are given, and the choice of decision process and planning horizon is examined.

J	Hoch, SJ; Schkade, DA				Hoch, SJ; Schkade, DA			A psychological approach to decision support systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision support systems; forecasting; managerial decision making; pattern matching	JUDGMENT; MODELS; SIMILARITY; DESIGN	Rapid advances in information technology have brought decision makers the mixed blessing of an increasingly vast amount of easily available data. Designers of decision support systems (DSS) have focused on incorporating the latest technology with little attention to whether these new systems are compatible with the psychology of decision makers. Our premise is that DSS should be designed to take advantage of the distinctive competencies of decision makers while using technology to compensate for their inherent weaknesses. In this study we apply this approach to a forecasting task. We find that to arrive at a forecast decision makers often search their experience for a situation similar to the one at hand and then make small adjustments to this previous situation. Our theoretical model of the performance of this intuitively appealing strategy shows that it performs reasonably well in highly predictable environments, but performs quite poorly in less predictable environments. Results from an experiment confirm these predictions and show that providing decision makers with a simple linear model in combination with a computerized database of historical cases improves performance significantly. We conclude by discussing how these results can be used to help improve forecasting in applied contexts, such as promotion forecasting in the retail grocery industry.

J	Feinberg, FM; Huber, J				Feinberg, FM; Huber, J			A theory of cutoff formation under imperfect information	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						choice models; optimal stopping; cutoffs; imperfect information; order statistics; random utility models	MODEL; SELECTION; CHOICE; SEARCH; VARIATE	Numerous models in the Management Science literature contain constructions that are a variant of the following: A decision-maker must choose from a set of alternatives based on imperfect information as to their relative quality, while further evaluation, though costly, provides more accurate information. We examine decision heuristics in which the optimal search policy entails a screening strategy limiting the number of alternatives in the subsequent, costly evaluation. There are two general methods for accomplishing this screening: Quota cutoffs operate by selecting the optimal number of alternatives to evaluate; Level cutoffs operate by specifying a minimally-acceptable level of the imperfect screening indicator. The present paper has three main objectives. First, to define the Level and Quota cutoff methods, broadly characterize optimal behavior for each and determine what aspects of the decision environment predispose one to be superior to the other; second, to introduce the concomitants of order statistics as a methodology for exploring decision problems when information is imperfectly known; and third, to discuss the pivotal role of default, or fallback, options in a broad class of search problems. Quota and Level strategies restrict the number of alternatives passing the cutoff-based screen. Because restrictive cutoffs reduce evaluation costs while lowering the expected quality of the item finally selected, changes in the decision environment making the evaluation process less beneficial or increasing its cost drive the optimal cutoff to be more restrictive. In particular, increases in unit evaluation cost, improvement in the quality of a fallback option, decreases in the total number of alternatives available or improvement in the precision of the final evaluation process all lead to more restrictive cutoffs at optimum. These results hold over a remarkably broad range of assumptions and conditions. We also find that a better screening indicator leads to more restrictive screening when evaluation costs are low but, surprisingly, to less restrictive screening when costs are high. Comparing the two strategies, we find the unexpected result that the Quota cutoff strategy is generally superior to the Level, except under one of two fairly uncommon sets of circumstances: when evaluation cost is prohibitively high, or when there is a fallback option of very high quality.

J	Szajna, B				Szajna, B			Empirical evaluation of the revised technology acceptance model	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						IS usage; technology acceptance model; IS implementation; perceived usefulness; ease of use	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; PERCEIVED USEFULNESS; USER ACCEPTANCE; EASE	Davis et al. (1989) proposed, tested, and revised the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which attempts to explain and predict why users sometimes accept and sometimes reject information systems (IS). The research reported here (1) provides a confirmatory, empirical test of the revised TAM and (2) introduces an objective measure of technology acceptance, actual usage rather than self-report usage. Subjects' beliefs about the usefulness and ease of use of an electronic mail system, their intentions to use the system, and their usage of it 15 weeks later were measured in a longitudinal study. The results confirmed that the TAM is a valuable tool for predicting intentions to use an IS. The findings here combined with results from other studies in this area suggest that the original TAM may be more appropriate than the two-version revised TAM. However, the addition of an experience component to the original TAM may be a significant enhancement. In addition, the results support that self-report usage may not be an appropriate surrogate measure for actual usage.

J	Chi, TL				Chi, TL			Performance verifiability and output sharing in collaborative ventures	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						joint ventures; transaction costs; double moral hazard; contracting; residual claimancy	MORAL HAZARD; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; COSTS	This paper studies the problem of contracting between two firms when they try to exploit their complementary resources in a collaborative venture (CV), but their performance in the CV cannot be precisely verified by the other party or by a third-party arbiter. Using a mathematical model that treats performance verifiability as a continuous variable, the paper first establishes that a party whose performance cannot be perfectly verified has an incentive to shirk if it is paid only a flat fee and that this shirking problem is more severe as its performance is less verifiable. Then, the paper shows in a general setting that a contract under which each party shares a fraction of the output is superior to a contract under which one of them is paid only a flat fee when performance verifiability is sufficiently low. In addition, with some specific assumptions about the forms of the revenue and cost functions, the paper also shows that a party's share of the venture's residual output in the equilibrium is an increasing function of its productivity and a decreasing function of its opportunity cost. Finally, the numerical examples constructed in the paper suggest that a contract which combines the self-enforcing mechanism of output sharing with the third-party enforcement mechanism of arbitration generally performs better than a contract that utilizes only one of these mechanisms.

Unfortunately, this literature offers no consensus regarding the net direction and magnitude of these various effects. This study analyzes the four types of ownership structure in the US hospital industry-private nonprofit, private for-profit, federal, and state and local government. Distance functions are used to measure technical efficiency of hospitals producing multiple outputs relative to other hospitals in the sample, allowing comparisons among the different ownership types.

J	Anupindi, R; Morton, TE; Pentico, D				Anupindi, R; Morton, TE; Pentico, D			The nonstationary stochastic lead-time inventory problem: Near-myopic bounds, heuristics, and testing	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic inventory; heuristics; leadtimes; nonstationary	MODEL	The purpose of the current paper is to combine the classical results of Kaplan (1970) and Ehrhardt (1984) for stochastic leadtime problems with recent work of Morton and Pentico (1991), which assumed zero lag, to obtain near-myopic bounds and heuristics for the nonstationary stochastic leadtime problem with arbitrary sequences of demand distributions, and to obtain planning horizon results. Four heuristics have been tested on a number of different demand scenarios over a number of random trials for four different leadtime distributions. The myopic (simplest) heuristic performs well only for moderately varying problems without heavy end of season salvaging, giving errors for this type of problem that are less than 1.5%. However, the average error for the myopic heuristic over all scenarios tested is 20.0%. The most accurate heuristic is the near-myopic heuristic which averages 0.5% from optimal across all leadtime distributions with a maximum error of 4.7%. The average error increases with increase in variance of the leadtime distribution.

J	Wang, YZ; Gerchak, Y				Wang, YZ; Gerchak, Y			Periodic review production models with variable capacity, random yield, and uncertain demand	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						inventory and production policies; stochastic dynamic programming; periodic review models		We investigate a production planning problem in a periodic review environment with variable production capacity, random yields, and uncertain demand. The implications of random yields and variable capacity for lot sizing previously have been explored separately, but not jointly. Many production environments are likely to be subject to both types of uncertainties. To minimize the total discounted expected costs (production, holding, and shortage costs), we formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For the finite-horizon problem, we prove that the objective function is quasi-convex and that the structure of the optimal policy is characterized by a single critical point for the initial stock level at each period. That is, if the initial stock is greater than this critical point, the optimal planned production is zero; Otherwise, it is greater than zero. Expressions for solving the critical point and the optimal planned production are obtained. We further show that the solution for the finite-horizon problem converges to that of the infinite-horizon problem.

J	Nath, R				Nath, R			A note on testing for skewness persistence	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bootstrap method; skewness estimation; distribution of stock returns	BOOTSTRAP	This paper shows that the tests of skewness persistence considered by Muralidhar (1993) far exceed the true Type I error. That is, the probabilities of detecting an increase (decrease) in skewness from one time period to another when in fact there is no change are inflated. Consequently, the higher power achieved by these tests comes at the cost of a higher than specified level of Type I error. We propose a new test which maintains the specified Type I error levels. Additionally, the power of this test for lognormal distributions is reported.

The algorithm is based on the standard dynamic programming approach which requires the computation of the minimal costs for all possible subplans of the production plan. Instead of computing these costs in a straightforward manner, we use structural properties of optimal subplans to arrive at a more efficient implementation. Our algorithm improves upon the O(T-4) running time of an earlier algorithm.

J	Goodhue, DL				Goodhue, DL			Understanding user evaluations of information systems	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						user evaluations of IS; task technology fit; measurement of MIS success	DECISION-MAKING; SMALL BUSINESS; MODEL; SATISFACTION; STRATEGIES; SUCCESS; FIT; ACCESSIBILITY; DETERMINANTS; ACQUISITION	Organizations spend millions of dollars on information systems to improve organizational or individual performance, but objective measures of system success are extremely difficult to achieve. For this reason, many MIS researchers (and potentially MIS practitioners) rely on user evaluations of systems as a surrogate for MIS success. However, these measures have been strongly criticized as lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, empirical evidence of their efficacy is surprisingly weak. Part of the explanation for the theoretical and empirical problems with user evaluations is that they are really a measurement technique rather than a single theoretical construct. User evaluations are elicited beliefs or attitudes about something, and they have been used to measure a variety of different ''somethings.'' What is needed for user evaluations to be an effective measure of IS success is the identification of some specific user evaluation construct, defined within a theoretical perspective that can usefully link underlying systems to their relevant impacts. We propose task-technology fit (TTF) as such a user evaluation construct. The TTF perspective views technology as a means by which a goal-directed individual performs tasks. TTF focuses on the degree to which systems characteristics match user task needs. We posit that higher task-technology fit will result in better performance. Further, we posit that users can successfully evaluate task-technology fit. This latter proposition is strongly supported in a survey of 259 users in 9 companies.

J	Poppo, L				Poppo, L			Influence activities and strategic coordination: Two distinctions of internal and external markets	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						comparative institutional performance; transaction costs; multidivisional corporation; hybrid organizations; influence activities	SUPPLIERS; INDUSTRY; COSTS	This paper examines empirically two distinctions of internal and external markets: influence activities and strategic coordination. Influence activities that arise from decentralization, imperfect monitoring, and a relative performance system are a potential liability of internal markets; coordination may be worse in internal markets than in external markets. However, strategic coordination is an advantage of internal markets: a hierarchy can more effectively implement strategic policies in internal markets than external markets. The results of this study show that profit center managers engage in influence activities by haggling over price adjustments, causing greater renegotiation costs in internal markets than in comparable external markets. However, implementation of cost reduction, which is a strategic policy, appears to be more effective in internal markets: the results show that supplying profit centers disclose more private cost information than external market suppliers. Thus cooperation and competition appear to operate simultaneously in internal markets. In addition, the results suggest that internal markets appear to undermine one advantage of a vertical integration strategy: the creation of unique assets, an organizational resource that can generate rents. These results, which are based on data gathered from the internal and external markets of one Fortune 100 company, are exploratory and further work is needed to generalize the findings.

While as compact as an influence diagram, the sequential diagram captures the asymmetric and sequential aspects of decision problems as effectively as decision trees. We show that a unified framework, consisting of a sequential diagram, an influence diagram, and a common formulation table for the problem's data, suffices for compact and consistent representation, economical formulation, and efficient solution of (asymmetric) decision problems. In addition to asymmetry, the framework exploits other sources of computational efficiency, such as conditional independence and value function decomposition, making it also useful in evaluating dynamic-programming problems. The formulation table and recursive algorithm can be readily implemented in computers for solving large-scale problems. Examples are provided to illustrate the methodology in both asymmetric and symmetric cases.

Using classical assumptions from the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, the theoretical price can be computed as the discounted expected value of future cash flows under the modified risk-neutral information process. Although analytical solutions have been developed elsewhere for a few particular option pricing problems, computing the arbitrage prices of securities under several sources of uncertainty is still an open problem in many instances. In this paper, we present efficient numerical techniques based upon Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European contingent claims depending on an arbitrary number of risk sources. We introduce in particular the method of quadratic resampling (QR), a new powerful error reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulation. Quadratic resampling can be efficiently combined with classical variance reduction methods such as importance sampling. Our numerical experiments show that the method is practical for pricing claims depending on up to one hundred underlying assets.

J	Rathnam, S; Mahajan, V; Whinston, AB				Rathnam, S; Mahajan, V; Whinston, AB			Facilitating coordination in customer support teams: A framework and its implications for the design of information technology	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						customer support; coordination; business process analysis; groupware	FIT	The management of coordination gaps is critical to the effective functioning of a customer support team. To address the managerial challenge of designing Information Technology (IT) to facilitate coordination in customer support teams, this paper develops a framework describing the drivers of coordination gaps in customer support teams. Measures for the characteristics of problem resolution processes, the characteristics of IT that assist in the management of coordination gaps, and coordination gaps are developed and validated. Results from a field study administered to 399 respondents from 41 teams in Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Seton Hospital, and Southwestern Bell support the proposition that coordination gaps arise from a lack of fit between the characteristics of problem resolution processes used and the characteristics of IT used. What is more important, the results also indicate that processes with differing characteristics require different kinds of IT.

J	Guler, O; Roos, C; Terlaky, T; Vial, JP				Guler, O; Roos, C; Terlaky, T; Vial, JP			A survey of the implications of the behavior of the central path for the duality theory of Linear Programming	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						linear inequalities; Linear Programming; interior points; duality; complementarity; Farkas Lemma; boundedness; unboundedness	NONLINEAR GEOMETRY; LIMITING BEHAVIOR; TRAJECTORIES; ALGORITHMS; AFFINE	The literature in the field of interior point methods for Linear Programming has been almost exclusively algorithmic oriented. Very few contributions have been made towards the theory of Linear Programming itself. In particular none of them offer a simple, self-contained introduction to the theory of Linear Programming and linear inequalities. The purpose of this paper is to show that the interior point methodology can be used to introduce the field of Linear Programming. Starting from scratch, and using only elementary results from calculus and linear algebra, we prove that for every value of the barrier parameter, the logarithmic barrier function for the primal-dual problem has a unique minimizer, and that the path of these minimizers (the central path) converges to a strictly complementary pair of optimal solutions. These results were proved more than a decade ago with advanced mathematical arguments. Our proofs are new: they are also simpler and often more natural than the ones currently known. They provide a new approach to the fundamental results of Linear Programming, including the existence of a strictly complementary solution, and the strong duality theorem.

We then exhibit two such procedures that exploit the variance-reduction technique of common random numbers to reduce the sample size required to attain a fixed precision. One procedure is based on the Bonferroni inequality and is guaranteed to be statistically conservative. The other procedure is exact under a specific dependence structure, but may be slightly liberal otherwise. Both are easy to apply, requiring only simple calculations and tabled constants. We illustrate the procedures with a numerical example.

J	Andradottir, S				Andradottir, S			A method for discrete stochastic optimization	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation; random walks; nonhomogeneous Markov chains		This paper addresses the problem of optimizing a function over a finite or countably infinite set of alternatives, in situations where this objective function cannot be evaluated exactly, but has to be estimated or measured. A special focus is on situations where simulation is used to evaluate the objective function. We present two versions of a new iterative method for solving such discrete stochastic optimization problems. In each iteration of the proposed method, a neighbor of the ''current'' alternative is selected, and estimates of the objective function evaluated at the current and neighboring alternatives are compared. The alternative that has a better observed function value becomes the next current alternative. We show how one version of the proposed method can be used to solve discrete optimization problems where the objective function is evaluated using transient or steady-state simulation, and we show how the other version can be applied to solve a special class of discrete stochastic optimization problems and present some numerical results. A major strength of the proposed method is that it spends most of the computational effort at local minimizers of the objective function. In fact, we show that for both versions of the proposed method, the alternative that has been visited most often in the first m iterations converges almost surely to a local optimizer of the objective function as m goes to infinity.

J	Beroggi, GEG; Wallace, WA				Beroggi, GEG; Wallace, WA			Operational control of the transportation of hazardous materials: An assessment of alternative decision models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						decision support systems; hazardous material transportation; ordinal preference; multiattribute utility		Commercially available tracking systems based on advanced communications and computing technology allow a dispatcher of hazardous material transports to monitor the movement of vehicles on a transportation network in real time. When unexpected events occur, a dispatcher working with this new technology can identify the regions surrounding the transportation network that are affected by these events and determine safe and cost-effective routes for the vehicles that plan to drive through those regions. Four decision models for rerouting hazardous material vehicles in real-time have been assessed in an experimental setting. The first model supports a dispatcher in finding alternative routes (visually), while the second model adds to the display, for each vehicle, an alternative route based on a conservative heuristic. The other two models are based on an ordinal preference and a numerical utility structure to support the dispatcher in determining the impact of the events on transportation safety and costs. The models were embedded into four decision support systems that use multimedia technology to simulate the dispatchers workstations. These systems were then used in an experiment at the dispatching school in Wil, Switzerland, with 32 experienced dispatchers and truck drivers to assess efficiency and accuracy of the four models. The results show that assessing risks and costs with the ordinal preference structure, prior to making routing decisions, is significantly more efficient and accurate than searching directly for new routes. Using a numerical scale for safety and cost assessment was disliked by the subjects and led to inferior results.

J	Roth, AV; Jackson, WE				Roth, AV; Jackson, WE			Strategic determinants of service quality and performance: Evidence from the banking industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						operations strategy; capabilities-based competition; absorptive capacity; resource based view; competitive advantage; service management performance	COMPETITION; FIT	This paper focuses on an important new service management strategy: the operations capabilities-service quality-performance (C-SQ-P) triad. In order to understand what generic operations capabilities influence the strategic behavior of high performing service firms, we explore three related questions: What generic operations capabilities are among the strategic determinants of service quality? Does service quality affect market performance? How is market conduct related to the C-SQ-P triad? These questions are investigated using a stylized capabilities-based model of service quality that simultaneously assesses their impact upon a firm's market performance. Several insights emerge from our research: a) generic operations capabilities affect service quality and performance, although not all relationships are direct; b) service quality know-how and innovations can be directly observed and imitated; c) the effects of technological leadership and market acuity on service quality are moderated by the absorptive capacity of employees to recognize and exploit their potential, and hence, investments in people are critical to success; d) market conduct influences the generic capabilities of the firm more than market performance, ceteris paribus; and e) total factor productivity and service quality are negatively correlated.

J	Kellogg, DL; Chase, RB				Kellogg, DL; Chase, RB			Constructing an empirically derived measure for customer contact	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article							LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS; SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS; DESIGN; MODEL	This research provides an empirically derived measurement model for customer contact, a widely used construct in service management. The model was created by applying two psychometric scaling techniques, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and the method of paired comparisons, and Content Analysis, to the ratings and responses of service research experts. MDS showed that the construct of Customer Contact is multidimensional and complex. An interval scale was developed using the paired comparison methodology, and a measurement model was developed using this contact scale. The central finding was that the degree or level of contact can be measured at the episode level by averaging the normalized values of communication time, the information richness, and the level of intimacy. The uses of the measurement model include refining current research and reevaluating past research, developing contingency models for service quality and design, and providing practitioners with a richer understanding of customer contact to facilitate service system design.

J	Darr, ED; Argote, L; Epple, D				Darr, ED; Argote, L; Epple, D			The acquisition, transfer, and depreciation of knowledge in service organizations: Productivity in franchises	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational learning; learning curves; productivity; knowledge transfer	LEARNING-CURVE	The paper examines the acquisition, depreciation and transfer of knowledge acquired through learning by doing in service organizations. The analysis is based on weekly data collected over a one and a half year period from 36 pizza stores located in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The 36 stores, which are franchised from the same corporation, are owned by 10 different franchisees. We find evidence of learning in these service organizations: as the organizations gain experience in production, the unit cost of production declines significantly. Knowledge acquired through learning by doing is found to depreciate rapidly in these organizations. Knowledge is found to transfer across stores owned by the same franchisee but not across stores owned by different franchisees. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.

J	Sulek, JM; Lind, MR; Marucheck, AS				Sulek, JM; Lind, MR; Marucheck, AS			The impact of a customer service intervention and facility design on firm performance	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						service quality; customer satisfaction; customer service intervention; service standards; facility design; service productivity	PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS; QUALITY; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; GOODNESS; ISSUES; SCALE; FIT	The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of a customer service intervention and store design on store performance within a regional food retailing chain. A longitudinal study examines the organization's implementation of a customer service intervention which utilized new service standards and customer feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the chain provided a natural experiment, since the forty-six stores in this chain represented three levels of facility design ranging from the traditional supermarket to the extended ''store of the future'' format. A theoretical model relating the customer service intervention, variations in store design, and customer satisfaction to sales performance was developed. Using both operational performance data from each of the stores and 1,537 responses from customer satisfaction surveys, a LISREL model was used to test the predictive fit of the model. The results indicate that both the store design and the customer service intervention had a significant, positive impact on customer satisfaction which, in turn, significantly affected sales performance (sales per labor hour). In addition, the customer service intervention had a direct effect on sales performance, although there was no support for a direct relationship between store design and sales performance. This research provides a theoretical basis in helping management understand how to leverage customer service for improved sales performance.

J	GalOr, E				GalOr, E			Maintaining quality standards in franchise chains	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						marketing, channels of distribution; franchising; quality management	INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; AGENCY; FIRM	In the present paper we identify those characteristics of the markets served by a franchise chain which determine the relative incentives of the owner of the chain to monitor the behavior of individual franchisees. We find that the owner has greater incentives to monitor the outlets that serve the relatively smaller markets and those that are subject to greater fluctuations in the state of the demand confronting them.

J	Dobbs, IM				Dobbs, IM			Hiring and leasing with nonlinear prices	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						hiring; leasing; nonuniform pricing; price discrimination; quantity discounts		This paper examines the problem of a monopolist setting an optimal nonlinear pricing schedule in the face of consumers of unknown type who arrive randomly over time and self-select a choice of hire period. The major determinant of pricing policy is the customer arrival distribution, with the overall level of price higher than in the atemporal yield management/nonuniform pricing solution by a margin which increases with the average frequency with which potential customers arrive. By contrast, the solution is generally fairly insensitive to variations in the time rate of discount, although there is a tendency for the rate of price discount to increase with increases in the time discount rate.

We analyze variants of this problem using a model with a conventional function describing the waiting cost, that is modified to account for some aspects of the psychological cost of waiting in line. We show that consideration of the psychological cost can result in prescriptions that are inconsistent with the common wisdom of queuing theorists derived according to the conventional approach (e.g., equal load assignments). More generally, our intention in this paper is to illustrate that aspects of the psychological cost of waiting can be accounted for in the analysis of queuing systems, and that this may have significant implications for the service schemes that are derived.

J	Sampson, SE; Weiss, EN				Sampson, SE; Weiss, EN			Increasing service levels in conference and educational scheduling: A heuristic approach	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						timetabling; scheduling; heuristics; services management	ALGORITHMS; SCHOOL	This paper explores a technique for developing a conference (or class) schedule that maximizes the servicing of participant requests for sessions. Data regarding participant interests are collected before the time the schedule is generated. The problem contains two principal parts: (1) to feasibly assign session offerings to time periods and rooms, and (2) to assign participants to sections of multiple-offering sessions. A heuristic procedure that simultaneously solves both parts is described and tested. The procedure considers not only the participants' requests for sessions, but also the relative importance of the various requests. Benefits of request prioritization are described. Results show that this approach can result in significantly improved participant satisfaction and equity when compared with traditional conference- and class-scheduling approaches.

Survey data were collected from 822 respondents in 41 plants in the transportation, electronics, and machinery industries in the U.S. These plants included random samples of U.S.-owned and Japanese-owned manufacturers in the U.S., and manufacturers reputed to use advanced manufacturing practices. Analysis indicates that manufacturing strategy and organizational culture are related, and that a manufacturer with a well-aligned and implemented manufacturing strategy exhibits a collectivist or group-oriented organizational culture with coordinated decision making, decentralized authority, and a loyal work force.

Project activities have fixed durations and may require the use of multiple renewable resources in constant amounts throughout their duration. Various assumptions may be made about the type of precedence relations, ready times, due dates, and task interruptability. Given a discrete, non-decreasing cost function of the constant resource availability for every resource type, the objective is to determine the resource availability levels in order to minimize the sum of the availability costs over all resource types. An effective optimal algorithm is described and extensive computational experience is reported.

The scenario is standard in all respects save one: Instead of arriving unannounced, customers provide advance warning of their demands. How should we use this information, and what is its effect on system performance? The answers turn out to be strikingly simple: There are very simple policies which perform effectively, in some cases optimally. Also, such ''demand leadtimes'' improve performance, in precisely the same way that replenishment leadtimes degrade it.

J	Desai, PS; Srinivasan, K				Desai, PS; Srinivasan, K			Demand signalling under unobservable effort in franchising: Linear and nonlinear price contracts	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						franchising; channels; marketing; signalling; game theory; pricing; asymmetric information models	ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; PRODUCT QUALITY; PRINCIPAL; ENTRY	We study the signalling strategy of a principal who is privately informed about its high demand potential to an uninformed risk-neutral agent. We analyze the model in the context of a contract between a franchisor and a franchisee. We examine the distortions of a two-parr pricing scheme necessary to credibly inform the franchisee (agent). We also study whether the inability of the franchisor (principal) to observe the agent's effort moderates or exaggerates the distortions from the first-best two-part pricing scheme. A surprising outcome is that even though the principal incurs greater signalling cost, the magnitude of distortion in the two-part scheme is smaller when service is unobservable than when it is not. Thus, a signalling strategy employing the fixed and variable fees is harder to detect under moral hazard. Empirical studies failing to control for moral hazard may incorrectly conclude that signalling strategy does not occur. We later consider a three-part scheme to verify whether or not the scheme reduces signalling cost. Interestingly, we find that there exists a unique three-part scheme that results in the first-best profit even in the presence of two-sided information asymmetries. While the two-part scheme can never achieve the first-best profit, the three-part scheme always achieves the first-best profit, The costless three-part separating scheme relies on variable income to induce the agent to undertake first-best service. The reliance on variable income to alleviate moral hazard contrasts with the two-part scheme's focus on reducing the variable income to overcome the inability to monitor. The finding provides additional empirical implications.

J	Monteverde, K				Monteverde, K			Technical dialog as an incentive for vertical integration in the semiconductor industry	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						transaction costs; fabless semiconductor firms; technical dialog; vertical integration	AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; APPROPRIABLE RENTS; COSTS; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGY	A curious structural change observed in the American semiconductor industry (the appearance of a class of ''fabless'' firms) is examined within a general transaction costs framework. The framework is refined for empirical application with the introduction of the construct ''unstructured technical dialog.'' The necessary level of this form of interpersonal communication between engineers in the design and fabrication stages of production is hypothesized to be positively related to the efficiency of a vertically integrated structure in which both stages are organized under a single hierarchy. ''Fablessness'' (i.e., the organizational separation of the design and fabrication stages) is argued to be efficient for only these firms whose particular product portfolios have only a minimal requirement for such unstructured technical dialog. The hypothesis is tested upon a set of relatively young semiconductor firms. Support is found for the theoretically derived relationship even after controlling for rival explanations found in the literature.

J	Benson, PG; Curley, SP; Smith, GF				Benson, PG; Curley, SP; Smith, GF			Belief assessment: An underdeveloped phase of probability elicitation	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						belief assessment; reasoning; judgment; probability assessment; subjective probability	DECISION-ANALYSIS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITIES; COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE; INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS; KNOWLEDGE; UNCERTAINTY; JUDGMENTS	A cognitive analysis of subjective probability is applied to the evaluation of techniques used by decision analysts for eliciting: probabilities from experts. The construction of a subjective probability requires both the formation of a belief and the assessment of a probability that qualifies the belief. The former process involves judgment and reasoning; the latter ig purely judgmental. Subjective probabilities have traditionally been portrayed and studied as arising from judgment: Consequently, belief assessment procedures have been particularly underdeveloped. Procedures currently used by analysts to aid belief assessment are classified and evaluated. Although such procedures facilitate the communication of beliefs and offer important guidance for constructing probabilities, additional prescriptive development is possible. It is argued that significant improvements in assessment practice can be realized by providing better support for the reasoning employed by experts in belief assessment. Opportunities for descriptive and prescriptive research in belief assessment are identified.

The answers can subsequently be used to help forest managers respond to changes in the environment such as fires or changes in market prices, without any additional computation. Furthermore, the characterization of the response we provide requires no prior knowledge of optimal management policies.

Individual productivity is modeled as a random variable, the distribution of which is a function of an unknown parameter. This parameter varies across the members of the group and is specified by a prior distribution. In this manner, the heterogeneity in the group is explicitly accounted for. We model the situation as a parameter adaptive Bayesian stochastic control problem, and use dynamic programming techniques and the appropriate optimality equations to obtain solutions. We prove the existence of an optimal policy in the general case. Further, for the case when the sales process can be characterized by a Beta-Binomial or a Gamma-Poisson distribution, we show that the optimal policy is of the threshold type at each evaluation period, depending only on the accumulated performance up to a given period. We present a computational procedure to solve for the optimal thresholds. Results of computational experiments show that an increase in the heterogeneity of the group can lead to more stringent levels of minimal acceptable performance.

J	Spector, YH; Tishler, A; Ye, YY				Spector, YH; Tishler, A; Ye, YY			Minimal adjustment costs and the optimal choice of inputs under time-of-use electricity rates	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						TOU rates; adjustment costs; electricity	CUSTOMER RESPONSE; LABOR DEMAND; INDUSTRIAL; EMPLOYEES; MARKET	In Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing schemes, utilities charge rates that depend on the time of day and the season of the year at which electricity is used. Estimates of the effects of TOU rates on business customers in the U.S. and Israel demonstrate that most firms do not appear to respond at all to newly introduced TOU rates, but those that do respond make substantial adjustments. In this paper we show that adjustment costs associated with changing the level of employment can explain the observed pattern of behavior in the U.S. and Israel. We apply our model to large industrial firms in Israel and show that it predicts their actual responses to TOU rates quite well.

It focuses on precedence- and resource-constrained (project) scheduling problems, but similar ideas may be applied to other network optimization problems. It describes a network construction procedure that takes into account a) constraints on the network topology, b) a resource factor that reflects the density of the coefficient matrix, and c) a resource strength, which measures the availability of resources. The strong impact of the chosen parametric characterization of the problems is shown via an in depth computational study. Instances for the single- and multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem are benchmarked by using the state of the art (branch and bound) procedures. The results provided, demonstrate that the classical benchmark instances used by several researchers over decades belong to the subset of the very easy ones. In addition, it is shown that hard instances, being far more smaller in size than presumed in the literature, may not be solved to optimality even within a large amount of computation time.

J	Whitt, W				Whitt, W			Variability functions for parametric-decomposition approximations of queueing networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						queueing networks; tandem queues; approximations; parametric-decomposition approximations; two-moment approximations; heavy traffic; squared coefficient of variation	SUPERPOSITION ARRIVAL PROCESSES; OPEN QUEUING-NETWORKS; RENEWAL PROCESS; PACKET QUEUES; POINT PROCESS; DEPENDENCE; WORKLOAD; VOICE	We propose an enhancement to the parametric-decomposition method for calculating approximate steady-state performance measures of open queueing networks with non-Poisson arrival processes and nonexponential service-time distributions. Instead of using a variability parameter c(a)(2) for each arrival process, we suggest using a variability function c(a)(2)(rho) 0 < rho < 1, for each arrival process; i.e., the variability parameter should be regarded as a function of the traffic intensity rho of a queue to which the arrival process might go. Variability functions provide a convenient representation of different levels of variability in different time scales for arrival processes that are not nearly renewal processes. Variability functions enable the approximations to account for long-range effects in queueing networks that cannot be addressed by variability parameters. For example, the variability functions provide a way to address the heavy-traffic bottleneck phenomenon, in which exceptional variability(either high or low) in the input has Little impact in a series of queues with low-to-moderate traffic intensities, and then has a big impact when it reaches a later queue with a relatively high traffic intensity. The variability functions also enable the approximations to characterize irregular periodic deterministic external arrival processes in a reasonable way; i.e., if there are no batches, then c(a)(2)(rho) should be 0 for rho near 0 or 1, but c(a)(2)(rho) can assume arbitrarily large values for appropriate intermediate p. We present a full network algorithm with variability functions, showing that the idea is implementable. We also show how simulations of single queues can be effectively exploited to determine variability functions for difficult external arrival processes.

We assume that the processing times are convex and nonincreasing in the amount of resources allocated to the machines. We consider the resource allocation problem for a fixed sequence of jobs for various performance criteria (makespan, weighted sum of completion times, cycle time for cyclic schedules), and develop a formulation of the problem as a convex program, where the number of constraints grows exponentially with the number of jobs and machines. We also present a generalization of the formulation for resource allocation problems in acyclic directed graphs. We demonstrate that the problem is NP-complete in the strong sense and present an effective solution procedure. The solution procedure is an implicit enumeration scheme where a surrogate relaxation of the formulation is used to generate upper and lower bounds on the optimal objective function value. Finally, we address the simultaneous scheduling and resource allocation problem, and we present an approximate and iterative solution procedure for the problem.

In contrast to the conventional approach, in which the product design is (nearly) completed before it is ''thrown over the wall'' to the process design group, concurrent design for manufacturability, as conceptualized here, conducts a number of progress reviews during the product design process. Frequent reviews have two benefits: (1) (Parallel Development) process designers receive sufficient information about the design to enable them to work in parallel with the product designers, and (2) (Quality Control) flaws in the design are discovered soon after they are introduced, saving the time and resources required for redesign later. The disadvantage of frequent reviews is that each review requires setup/penalty time that otherwise would not be required. The optimal policy is derived for some special stationary cases of the model. When the parallel development benefit dominates, the review periods either increase or decrease according to the rate at which product design work empowers useful process design work to be conducted. When the quality control benefit dominates, the review periods will vary only to the extent that the quality related parameters change. Numerical examples illustrate the insights gained from the analysis.	STANFORD UNIV,SCH BUSINESS,STANFORD,CA 94305	HA, AY (reprint author), YALE UNIV,SCH MANAGEMENT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.

The release times for all jobs are assumed to be zero. A new quadratic integer programming formulation is introduced. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) procedure is developed to find a lower bound (LB) to the optimal objective value. When the number of jobs is between 100 and 500, our computational study shows that the lower bounds obtained by the LR procedure are very close to the best known objective values. A new heuristic algorithm is also described. The first phase of the heuristic algorithm is a construction procedure whose purpose is to identify a good initial. sequence. The second phase is an improvement procedure based on pairwise interchanges. The new heuristic-algorithm provides improved solutions compared to the best known heuristic.

We integrate relevant theoretical concepts from transaction cost economics, organization theory and political economy to develop a conceptual model of interorganizational relationships based on the fit between information processing needs and information processing capabilities. This model is employed to collect data on 447 buyer-supplier relationships in these two countries. We empirically uncover a set of five naturally occurring patterns of interorganizational relationships. These configurations provide rich explanations of the complexity of interorganizational relationships as well as offer differential insights across United States and Japan. We discuss implications for further research pertaining to the logic and development of configurations.

Our basic assumptions are that the utility of a firm for joining a particular standard-setting alliance increases with the size of the alliance and decreases with the presence of rivals in the alliance, especially close rivals. The predicted alliance configurations are simply the Nash equilibria, i.e., those sets of alliances for which no single firm has an incentive to switch to another alliance. We illustrate our theory by estimating the choices of nine computer companies to join one of two alliances sponsoring competing Unix operating system standards in 1988.

J	WENG, ZK				WENG, ZK			CHANNEL COORDINATION AND QUANTITY DISCOUNTS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION INVENTORY POLICIES, PRICING, DETERMINISTIC MODELS; MARKETING PRICING; PRICE SENSITIVITY; PURCHASING	MODEL; PROFITS; POLICY	This paper presents a model for analyzing the impact of joint decision policies on channel coordination in a system consisting of a supplier and a group of homogeneous buyers. The joint decision policy characterized by the unit selling price and the order quantity is coordinated through quantity discounts and franchise fees. Both the annual demand rate and the operating cost-including the purchase, ordering, and inventory holding costs-depend on the joint decision policy employed. This paper contributes by integrating work addressing quantity discounts on inventory and ordering policies and work focusing on the control mechanism provided by quantity discounts in channel coordination. It is shown that the optimal all-unit quantity discount policy is equivalent to the optimal incremental quantity discount policy in achieving channel coordination. Furthermore, it is shown that quantity discounts alone are not sufficient to guarantee joint profit maximization. The analyses of the general models are illustrated by specific analytical results obtained for a given demand function.

J	BOINEY, LG				BOINEY, LG			WHEN EFFICIENT IS INSUFFICIENT - FAIRNESS IN DECISIONS AFFECTING A GROUP	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						FAIRNESS; EQUITY; DECISION MAKING; GROUPS; UTILITY; ENVY	PREFERENCE; INEQUITY; EQUITY; RISK	Many key decisions have significant consequences for a group of people, rather than a single individual. In some cases, traditional group decision making techniques such as negotiation, voting, or compromise can be employed by the group members themselves to determine a satisfactory course of action. In other instances, however, the intervention of a central decision maker may be necessary. Intervening on behalf of a group raises additional concerns for the decision maker, one of which is fairness. This paper builds upon envy-based fairness concepts from the fair allocation literature and theories of ex ante and ex post equitable distributions from the social risk literature to develop a model for choice among limited options under uncertainty when preferences are heterogeneous. The model is therefore appropriate when other existing models are not. An example demonstrates an application of the model for choice under uncertainty and contrasts the approach and decision recommendation with that of existing models. By quantifying the degree of envy rather than treating it dichotomously, the approach captures the balance between fairness and efficiency; some envy may be tolerated if it brings greater overall utility and/or if some envy already exists in the status quo option. Lastly, implementation issues and the impact of differing preferences and attitudes toward risk on fairness and efficiency considerations are explored.

J	CLYMAN, DR				CLYMAN, DR			UNREASONABLE RATIONALITY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						RATIONALITY; SUBJECTIVE EXPECTED UTILITY; DESCRIPTIVE OR BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY; LOG OR LOGARITHMIC UTILITY; FRACTIONAL DEMANDS; ARROW-DEBREU SECURITIES		This paper explores how fractional demands (the optimal fraction of wealth invested in a security) change upon exogenous changes in security returns and wealth. In the first part of the paper, the analysis is conducted in an Arrow-Debreu framework. Here we demonstrate the counterintuitive but completely rational result that fractional demands can remain unchanged or in fact decrease upon an exogenous increase in return. Furthermore, we show that this can occur without any offsetting wealth effect. In the second part of the paper, we apply these results to ordinary securities (those composed of fixed portfolios of Arrow-Debreu securities). Here eve derive a complete analytical solution and show that portfolio managers should beware. Even correct information that the return from holding an underlying pure security will improve is not sufficient to conclude that one should increase (or decrease) one's holdings of any particular stock.

Some of the data are considered confidential, and by law, the organization is required to provide appropriate security measures in order to preserve privacy. Yet a number of companies have little or no security measures. The reason for this lack of security may, at least in part, be attributed to a lack of awareness and empirical evidence about the relative effectiveness of security mechanisms. This study investigates the effectiveness of different security mechanisms for protecting numerical database attributes. The trade-off between security, accessibility, and accuracy are examined. A comparison of different security mechanisms reveals that fixed data perturbation is preferred because it maximizes both security and accessibility. An investigation of the different approaches to fixed data perturbation indicates that multiplicative method best meets these criteria.

J	BUGHIN, J				BUGHIN, J			UNION-FIRM BARGAINING AND THE INFLUENCE OF PRODUCT MARKET POWER AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY ON SYSTEMATIC-RISK	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	XI Latin-American Meeting of the Econometric-Society	SEP, 1992	MEXICO	Econometr Soc			TRADE UNION; EMPLOYMENT; UNIONIZATION; INDUSTRY; UNCERTAINTY; OLIGOPOLY; LEVERAGE; PROFITS; GROWTH; MODELS	The relationship between the CAPM firm beta and the firm's microeconomic decisions is studied by a model under uncertainty, which combines the feature of an ex ante ''inputs substituable'' production technology and the existence of a union which bargains over various economic dimensions of the firm. It is shown that the earlier findings of a relationship between the firm beta, the firm product market power, and the labor-capital ratio may be reinforced through the indirect channel of labor market bargaining, but the relationship becomes more complex, and heavily depends on the scope of the union-firm bargaining process. This yields the empirical prediction, confirmed for a panel of Belgian firms, that any proper estimation of the determinants of firm beta, must control for firms in the sample being unionized.

Our model is based on a Markov/semi-Markov treatment of changes in the weather, the principal source of uncertainty governing service times, together with a treatment of the arrival stream as time-varying but deterministic. The model is employed to compute moments of queue length and waiting time via a recursive algorithm. To test the model, we conduct a case study using traffic and capacity data for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Our results show that the model's estimates are reasonable, though substantial data difficulties make validation difficult. We explore, as examples of the model's potential usefulness, two policy questions: schedule interference between the two principal carriers, and the likely effects of demand smoothing policies on queueing delays.

J	LIBERATORE, MJ; STYLIANOU, AC				LIBERATORE, MJ; STYLIANOU, AC			EXPERT SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DECISION-MAKING - A MODELING FRAMEWORK AND APPLICATIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						EXPERT SUPPORT SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE-BASED DSS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; R-AND-D; PROJECT SELECTION; MANAGEMENT SCIENCE; VERIFICATION; INDUSTRIAL	A modeling framework that merges knowledge-based expert systems and decision support systems with management science methods for project evaluation is presented. In particular, the strategic decision to commit to full-scale development of a new product is considered. At the core of the framework are the methods and techniques used for acquiring, modeling and processing the expert knowledge and data. Methods and techniques used include scoring models, logic tables, the analytic hierarchy process, discriminant analysis, and rule-based systems. The suggested modeling approach obtains the benefits of normative modeling as well as the flexibility and developmental advantages of expert systems. Additional benefits include reduced information processing and gathering time, which can help to accelerate the product development cycle. Potential spin-offs of this research include applications for project evaluation throughout the product development cycle and other areas such as capital budgeting. Finally, a series of related case studies that have successfully implemented this framework is described.

The U.S. Department of Defense has experimented with splitting production quantities between two or more contractors in an effort to make government business more attractive for the private sector. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of this strategy. We find that in a two-period model with production learning and entry costs, dual sourcing, even for the specific mechanism we consider, in some cases, reduces overall expected cost. Moreover, if buyers are unable to commit to long-term contracts or suppliers are unable to bid away anticipated gains, the incentives to dual source are often stronger.

Despite the number of studies targeted at explaining system usage, there are crucial differences in the way the variable has been conceptualized and operationalized. This wide variation of system usage measures hinders the efforts of MIS researchers to compare findings across studies, thus impeding the accumulation of knowledge and theory in this area. The purpose of this paper is to address conceptual as well as methodological issues related to measuring system usage. First, via LISREL measurement modeling techniques, we compare subjective and objective measures of system usage, namely, self-reported versus computer-recorded measures. Next, using a modified form of Davis' Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a nomological net, we test the nomological validity of these system usage constructs and measures. Results of the LISREL measurement and nomological net analysis suggest that system usage should be factored into self-reported system usage and computer-recorded system usage. Contrary to expectations, these constructs do not appear to be strongly related to each other. Moreover, while self-reported measures of system usage are related to self-reported measures of TAM independent variables, objective, computer-recorded measures show distinctly weaker links. In the face of such counter-evidence, it is tempting to argue that research that has relied on subjective measures of system usage (for example, research confirming TAM) may be artifactual. There are several alternative explanations, though, that maintain the integrity of TAM and studies that measure system usage subjectively. These alternative explanations suggest directions for further research as well as new approaches to measurement.

J	WHANG, SJ				WHANG, SJ			MARKET PROVISION OF CUSTOM SOFTWARE - LEARNING EFFECTS AND LOW BALLING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						SOFTWARE ECONOMICS; CUSTOM SOFTWARE; BIDDING; LOW-BALLING	AUCTIONS; MODELS	Due to reusability of program code and learning effects in software development, development cost of custom software typically decreases in time and experience. This creates a first-mover advantage to software developers. The paper studies whether the benefits of declining development costs are passed on to buyers in the form of lower prices when developers bid strategically. By using a model of bidding auctions we characterize equilibrium bidding strategies of two software developers. In order to become the first mover and attain future market dominance, developers find it optimal to forgo profits from the first projects. As a result, bid prices (= development cost plus a profit margin to the developer) to the buyers may not necessarily decrease over time, and even if so, not as fast as development cost drops. We also show that bidders expect a higher profit margin from a high-variance project. Thus, if there exist high-variance projects in the future, developers are more likely to submit below-cost bid prices or ''low ball.''

We show that the SPHA is very good for a range of parameter values corresponding to a reasonably broad spectrum of real systems. However, we do find and document that there are many situations in which this approximation will be very inaccurate. We postulate and then support empirically a set of hypotheses that link the accuracy of the SPHA and the related point-wise stationary approximation (PSA) to key parameter values and model characteristics. We also present results on the time-dependent behavior of these systems as a function of key parameters. Finally we present results which indicate that our findings, developed for models with sinusoidal input streams, may apply to a much broader range of Markovian models with more general cyclic inputs.

These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal goods such as air-conditioners or winter coats before the end of the season. Given a fixed number of seats, rooms, or coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing or a single price change from a given initial price to either a given lower or higher second price. Under mild conditions, we show that it is optimal to decrease (resp., to increase) the initial price as soon as the time-to-go falls below (resp., above) a time threshold that depends on the number of yet unsold items.

The empirical results document that a significant component of the cross-sectional MSE in analysts' forecasts is systematic, and that parameter estimates from earlier periods enable the elimination of a substantial portion of the systematic errors in current forecasts. Further improvements in forecast accuracy are attained by the incorporation of prior-year excess security returns in order to reduce unsystematic error.

J	ROBINSON, SM				ROBINSON, SM			CONVERGENCE OF SUBDIFFERENTIALS UNDER STRONG STOCHASTIC CONVEXITY	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STRONG STOCHASTIC CONVEXITY; STRONG CONSISTENCY; INFINITESIMAL PERTURBATION ANALYSIS		We show that if a sequence of random functions satisfies strong stochastic convexity with respect to a parameter, and if the sequence converges pointwise with probability one, then any sequence of elements extracted from the subdifferentials of the functions in the sequence will converge to the subdifferential of the limiting function, again with probability one. This result holds with no differentiability assumption on the limiting function, and even if the limiting function is itself random. It thus extends earlier work, in particular results by Glynn and by Hu. One application is in proving an extended form of strong consistency for infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) when suitable convexity properties hold.

J	PAIK, TY; SEN, PK				PAIK, TY; SEN, PK			PROJECT EVALUATION AND CONTROL IN DECENTRALIZED FIRMS - IS CAPITAL RATIONING ALWAYS OPTIMAL	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PROJECT EVALUATION; CAPITAL RATIONING; AGENCY; PRE-CONTRACT PRIVATE INFORMATION	PRINCIPAL; AGENT; SELECTION; DESIGN	When capital investments are made in an agency setting, we show that, even without risk considerations, capital rationing need not be the only rational outcome. We analyze a principal-agent model with risk neutrality and with two productive inputs: the agent's efforts and capital investment. The two inputs can be either economic complements or substitutes. The agent has pre-contract private information about his own type. The output is measured with an additive noise. We show that when the two inputs are substitutes, the optimal solution entails a marginal capital rationing. But when the two inputs are complements, then either a marginal capital rationing or a marginal leniency could be the optimal response. Our results, therefore, provide an explanation for why firms may employ a capital rationing for a project that may increase manufacturing complexity and hence may reduce (managerial) labor productivity, yet employ a less strict criterion for evaluating a productivity-enhancing project. This result contrasts with earlier results where only a capital rationing is shown to be optimal.

A unit fails, or more generally, undergoes a change of state after a sufficient number of shocks. The shocks for a particular unit are assumed to arrive according to a time heterogeneous Poisson process. The time to a change of state, the transition time, for the unit has a generalized Gamma (gamma) distribution. We assume that the intensity of the Poisson process and the number of shocks until the change of state vary independently across the units according to a Gamma and negative binomial distribution, respectively. The distribution of the transition time is shown to be the generalized F distribution, which includes a number of standard distributions as special cases. We illustrate these results with two empirical examples: modelling coupon redemptions and traffic accidents. In the latter case, the intensity function of the Poisson process includes time varying predictor variables.

J	FISHBURN, P; WAKKER, P				FISHBURN, P; WAKKER, P			THE INVENTION OF THE INDEPENDENCE CONDITION FOR PREFERENCES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						EXPECTED UTILITY; INDEPENDENCE CONDITION; CONJOINT INDEPENDENCE; HISTORY OF UTILITY THEORY	EXPECTED UTILITY; DECISION; STATES	This paper discusses the history and interrelations of three central ideas in preference theory: the independence condition in decision under risk, the sure-thing principle in decision under uncertainty, and conjoint independence for multiattribute decisions and consumer theory. Independence was recognized as an important component of decision under risk in the late 1940s by Jacob Marschak, John Nash, Herman Rubin, and Norman Dalkey, and first appeared in publication in Marschak (1950) and Nash (1950). The sure-thing principle can be credited to Savage (1953, 1954). Conjoint independence for consumer theory was introduced by Sono (1943) and Leontief (1947a, b); a form of it can also be recognized in Samuelson (1947), presented earlier in Samuelson (1940). Independence and the sure-thing principle are equivalent for decision under risk, but in a less elementary way than has sometimes been thought. The sure-thing principle for decision under uncertainty and conjoint independence are identical in a mathematical sense. The mathematics underlying our three preference conditions has an older history. The independence condition for decision under risk can be recognized in the characterization of ''associative means,'' and conjoint independence for multiattribute decisions in solutions to the ''generalized associativity functional equation.''

J	BELL, DE				BELL, DE			A CONTEXTUAL UNCERTAINTY CONDITION FOR BEHAVIOR UNDER RISK	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						RISK AVERSION; VALUE OF INFORMATION; UTILITY FUNCTIONS; CONTEXTUAL UNCERTAINTY		Suppose that your choice between uncertain financial prospects is made more difficult by two independent contextual uncertainties concerning the size of your existing wealth. One contextual uncertainty has a greater spread than the other. If you could resolve one of these contextual uncertainties before making your choice, would you rather it be the larger or the smaller? In this paper we explore the intuitive notion that it ought to be more advantageous to resolve larger rather than smaller contextual uncertainties. The utility function for wealth u(w) = aw - be(-cw) (a, b, c greater than or equal to 0) is the only utility function that satisfies this condition and that is also increasing and risk averse at all wealth levels.

J	LEE, SW; CHANG, KP				LEE, SW; CHANG, KP			MEAN-VARIANCE-INSTABILITY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS - A CASE OF TAIWAN STOCK-MARKET	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS		This paper applies Talpaz, Harpaz, and Penson's (THP) (1983) mean-variance-instability portfolio selection model to eight selected Taiwan stocks during 1980-89 to demonstrate how instability preference affects the traditional mean-variance frontier. In contrast to THP's finding, the empirical results show that Taiwan's high-frequency stocks have high, not low, variance. This indicates that Taiwan investors, unlike U.S. investors, prefer to speculate in high-variance stocks. The empirical results also show that short selling may increase the risk of the portfolio when the investor is instability preferred.

We develop an algorithm that finds the most preferred alternative of a decision maker (DM) assuming only that the DM has a monotonic utility function. The algorithm divides the criteria space into a number of smaller subspaces and then uses the ideal points of these subspaces to eliminate alternatives. We also develop a more efficient version of the algorithm for the more restrictive case of a monotonic quasiconcave utility function. We present favorable computational results in terms of the required number of pairwise comparisons for both versions of the algorithm. We then develop a general algorithm that first identifies the type of the DM's utility function and then employs the approach that is compatible with the identified utility function type. We also present computational results for the general algorithm.	MAKERERE UNIV,KAMPALA,UGANDA	KOKSALAN, MM (reprint author), MIDDLE EAST TECH UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN,ANKARA 06531,TURKEY.

The model extends the original objective of the DEA methodology from measuring efficiency to include the evaluation of various aspects of effectiveness and equality considerations. The model is formulated as a linear program that can be solved by means of a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm. Theoretical properties of the model are compared with those corresponding to the model developed by Mandell (1991) to evaluate the trade-off between equity and effectiveness. A numerical example is used to illustrate the comparison between the models.

This framework is supported empirically from data from the health care industry using three types of data: (1) industry statistics, (2) case studies, and (3) questionnaire surveys. Our objective has been to: (1) gain a better understanding of the concept of focus as it applies to the health care sector, (2) develop a framework to assist service operations managers with focus decisions, and (3) develop a base from which to generalize about microfocusing decisions in professional services.

J	INGENE, CA; PARRY, ME				INGENE, CA; PARRY, ME			A NOTE ON MULTI-REGIONAL MARKETING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						MARKETING; MARKETING MIX; RESOURCE ALLOCATION; SEGMENTATION		This paper examines the profit maximizing behavior of a vertically integrated firm that operates in ''n'' geographically distinct regions. A pair of alternative managerial decision scenarios are considered. In one scenario, all marketing mix variables are manipulated at the regional level, so that each region may choose different levels of each marketing variable. In the second scenario, one marketing variable is manipulated ''globally,'' so that its level is identical in all regions. The first scenario generates an n-region version of the ''Dorfman-Steiner'' first-order conditions for profit maximization. However, under some cost structures the profits associated with this Dorfman-Steiner scenario are dominated by those associated with the second, ''Global-Regional'' scenario. This second scenario yields an optimal solution in which the global marketing variable may have a negative marginal impact on sales in some regions. As a result, some managerial implications of the second scenario differ strikingly from those of the Dorfman-Steiner scenario.

J	RAATIKAINEN, KEE				RAATIKAINEN, KEE			SIMULATION-BASED ESTIMATION OF PROPORTIONS	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION; SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION; RUN LENGTH CONTROL	W TEST; NORMALITY	Simulated estimates for several proportions are needed in many simulation studies. We propose a method for controlling the length of a simulation run so that the proportions estimated satisfy a prespecified precision requirement. The method applies the arcsin transform in order to generate confidence intervals with the desired width. The Bonferroni inequality is applied in a new way to construct a rectangular confidence area for the proportions being estimated. Since we are using the Bonferroni inequality, we can use the existing methods developed for estimating the variance of a single mean. The properties of the method proposed depend on three factors: 1) the arcsin transform, 2) the proposed way of applying the Bonferroni inequality, and 3) the method for estimating the variance. We examine the effects that the transform and the way of applying the Bonferroni inequality have. Empirical results indicate that the method provides estimates that satisfy the prespecified precision requirement, when the spectral method is used to estimate the variances of the proportions. In addition, simulation runs, when estimating either several proportions or the corresponding mean, are about the same lengths.

J	ETTLIE, JE				ETTLIE, JE			PRODUCT-PROCESS DEVELOPMENT INTEGRATION IN MANUFACTURING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						NEW PRODUCTS; INTEGRATED DESIGN MANUFACTURING; INDUSTRY DIFFERENCES	R-AND-D; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVES; TECHNOLOGIES; INNOVATION; ACHIEVE; TIME	Organizations vary greatly in their approaches and success in the introduction of new products and services. In this study, it was proposed that much of this variance can be captured by understanding the extent to which product design and process design are integrated in new program launches. A mailed survey of 43 domestic firms was used to test four propositions concerning product-process development practices. Significantly, it was found that firms using the more rare design-manufacturing personnel integrating mechanisms (engineering job rotation and mobility) have higher sales per employee. Results of a discriminant analysis show that firms benchmarking on product development practices, as contrasted with performance benchmarks, were significantly more likely to use both the rare and the more common forms of design-manufacturing integration (i.e., train personnel in new design, methods, have manufacturing sign-off on design reviews, and restructure, e.g., use teams). Significantly, these firms also report a greater proportion of degreed manufacturing engineers. Not surprisingly, larger firms and business units were found to take longer to develop new products.

This question, which has elicited some theoretical answers and a few empirical tests in a domestic setting, has never been addressed in an international context before. This study explains the mode of control chosen in terms of a theoretical framework which borrows from agency theory and transaction cost analysis. The propensity to franchise internationally was found to be directly related to (i) monitoring costs associated with geographical and ''cultural'' distance between the principal (franchisor) and its foreign agents (franchisees), (ii) the principal's international experience, and (iii) the degree of host countries' contextual uncertainty but inversely related to the service firm level of brand name asset specificity.

In order to globally disaggregate services, corporations must decide whether or not to carry out a service activity within the organization, and where to locate it, within or outside the geographic boundary of the home-base country. This paper analyzes the opportunities and challenges of global disaggregation of information-intensive services. Specifically, the paper proposes a taxonomy of disaggregation, and develops a theoretical framework that identifies the criteria and guidelines for successfully selecting service activities to be globally disaggregated.

In this note, we point out that the merits of such a warning for JIT production systems are questionable. If we treat a setup as a PERT network, it is difficult to accept S-Z claim that waiting queues can grow without bound when setup time is reduced. Furthermore, we show that the amount of setup cut, in addition to the level of variance, can determine whether waiting time grows or not. This finding can help in planning a viable setup reduction project. Additionally, we use S-Z example to show that, even when the variances are not reduced proportionately, the expected waiting time does not necessarily increase.

In this study, high breakdown robust methods are used in conjunction with a robust distance measure defined relative to the minimum volume ellipsoid estimator. The standardized robust residuals from the high breakdown estimators and the robust distance measures are used to statistically and graphically depict both multivariate outliers and leverage points. Once these points are found, their relationship to those observations that exhibit strong technically efficient or inefficient behavior, scale inefficiency and/or unusual production characteristics is analyzed for three linerboard manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the impact of the outliers and leverage points on the estimated least squares coefficients which are used by the corrected ordinary least squares methodology to compute the full-frontier technical efficiency measures is explored. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the impact of outliers and leverage points on the computed linear programming based technical efficiency measures is presented.

We also investigate market characteristics that help explain differences in store brand market share across product categories. Our findings suggest that the introduction of a store brand is likely to increase retailer's profits in a product category if the cross-price sensitivity among national brands is low and the cross-price sensitivity between the national brands and the store brand is high. Our model predicts that the store brand share would also be greater under these conditions. In addition, we find that the introduction of a store brand is more likely to lead to an increase in category profits if the category consists of a large number of national brands-even though the store brand market share is expected to be lower when there are a large number of national brands. We compare the key predictions of our model with data on 426 grocery product categories. The data are consistent with the predictions of the model.

J	CASEY, JT				CASEY, JT			PREDICTING BUYER-SELLER PRICING DISPARITIES	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						JUDGMENT; DECISION MAKING; RISK; PREFERENCE; PRICING; CERTAINTY EQUIVALENTS; CONTINGENT VALUATION	PROSPECT-THEORY; WILLINGNESS; PAY; DECISION; CHOICE; ECONOMICS; ACCEPT	Numerous studies have shown that compensation demanded (CD) to give up a commodity often greatly exceeds willingness to pay (WTP) to obtain the same commodity, even in incentive compatible experiments that penalize strategic misrepresentation. Observed CD/WTP disparities are too large to be reconciled with traditional assumptions of economic rationality. A prospect theory-based behavioral framework for predicting CD and WTP is proposed which produces five distinct transaction encoding rules, any one of which can in principle apply to a buyer or a seller. According to this framework, CD/WTP gaps occur when buyers and sellers encode the prospective transaction differently, and gaps can occur in multiple ways, and vary in size, depending on encoding. The transaction encoding framework was tested in two experiments. In Experiment 1, model fits to subjects' CD and WTP for lottery tickets were consistent with the hypothesis that buyers and sellers encode transaction problems differently. Moreover, the quite large observed CD/WTP gaps were explained fully by encoding: When differences between buyers' and sellers' encoding processes were taken into account, their estimated utility (value) and probability weighting functions did not differ. The present framework and results show that the widely cited endowment effect is but one of several ways in which loss aversion can give rise to CD/WTP gaps. Consistent with this broadened perspective, Experiment 2 demonstrated CD/WTP gaps in the absence of an endowment effect (and in the absence of rational economic causes). The transaction encoding framework (1) provides a structured approach for predicting and testing the effects of a variety of task factors on pricing behavior and transaction outcomes, and (2) reveals the useful property that, in many cases, the ratio CD/WTP can be interpreted as a direct measure of the degree of loss aversion.

J	OU, JH; WEIN, LM				OU, JH; WEIN, LM			DYNAMIC SCHEDULING OF A PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEM WITH BY-PRODUCTS AND RANDOM YIELD	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						PRODUCTION SCHEDULING; QUEUES; RANDOM YIELD	HEAVY TRAFFIC ANALYSIS; QUEUES; NETWORKS	Motivated by semiconductor wafer fabrication, we consider a scheduling problem for a single-server multiclass queue. A single workstation fabricates semiconductor wafers according to a variety of different processes, where each process consists of multiple stages of service with a different general service time distribution at each stage. A batch (or lot) of wafers produced according to a particular process randomly yields chips of many different product types, and completed chips of each type enter a finished goods inventory that services exogenous customer demand for that type. The scheduling problem is to dynamically decide whether the server should be idle or working, and in the latter case, to decide which stage of which process type to serve next. The objective is to minimize the long run expected average cost, which includes costs for holding work-in-process inventory (which may differ by process type and service stage) and backordering and holding finished goods inventory (which may differ by product type). We assume the workstation must be busy the great majority of the time in order to satisfy customer demand, and approximate the scheduling problem by a control problem involving Brownian motion. A scheduling policy is derived by interpreting the exact solution to the Brownian control problem in terms of the production/inventory system. The proposed dynamic scheduling policy takes a relatively simple form and appears to be effective in numerical studies.

Proponents of formal output analysis view this approach as dangerous and irresponsible. We designed and executed a laboratory experiment in which 51 subjects solved a case study based around the allocation of trucks in a mining operation in order to investigate the efficacy of VIS to model experimentation. Subjects were provided with a VIS, developed by the authors, which contained a terminating simulation of the system and two different displays: an animation and a dynamically changing histogram. The user could halt execution of the model and change the truck allocation at any time. We found that subjects performed badly relative to a known solution obtained through detailed formal experimentation but performed well compared to solutions they provided prior to use of the model. Use of the animated display was not associated with correct solutions but was associated with more efficient use of the VIS. Subjects who obtained a correct solution investigated fewer alternatives and used fewer interactions than those obtaining incorrect solutions. Finally, we found a significant difference in the process used between subjects providing correct and incorrect solutions.

In this work we present generalized results for the same systems under k-stage blocking. One-stage blocking is the so-called manufacturing blocking in which a job entering the jth service position in the sequence requires attendance by the jth server only. Upon completion of service the job will move to position (j + 1) if that position is not occupied. Otherwise, it will continue to stay in position j, blocking it, until the next position is vacated. Two-stage blocking is the so-called communication blocking in which a job entering the jth position needs simultaneous attendance by the jth and the (j + 1)-th servers. Thus, start of service may be delayed until the (j + 1)-th server is freed. In k-stage blocking, the job requires at each position in the sequence the joint attendance of the server of that position together with the servers of the next k - 1 positions. One interesting result is that for k > 1 the waiting times are not order-insensitive while the G/D/1 equivalence is maintained.

(HZR) (1981) developed a betting system that demonstrated positive profits at two racetracks. The system assumes running times are distributed exponentially, but other distributions for running times (Henery 1981 and Stem 1990) have been shown to produce a better fit in Bacon-Shone et al. (1992a), Lo (1994), and Lo and Bacon-Shone (1994) using data from Hong Kong, the Meadowlands, and Japan. The better fit is at the cost of severely increased complexity in computing ranking probabilities, though. In response, Lo and Bacon-Shone (1992) proposed a simple model of computing ranking probabilities which closely approximates those based on the Henery and the Stern models and fits the data as well. This paper couples the Lo and Bacon-Shone model and the HZR system. For data sets from the United States and Hong Kong, we show improved profit over the HZR system at lower levels of risk using final betting data assuming zero computational costs. With data from Japan, our model shows little difference in profits from the HZR system.

J	PAVIA, TM				PAVIA, TM			PROFIT MAXIMIZING COST ALLOCATION FOR FIRMS USING COST-BASED PRICING	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						COST ALLOCATION; PRICING; MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING	ELECTRICITY; CONTRACTS; DEMAND; RATES	This work develops a profit maximizing cost allocation scheme for firms that allocate all costs to their various outputs and then use these costs to set prices, a process known as fully-distributed cost-based pricing. If the costs incurred by the firm are not easily traced to a particular output (for example, the electric bill for a shared manufacturing plant), the costs must be allocated. The demand for a given output is assumed to be a function of the price. Hence, the cost allocation scheme that is selected will affect both the price and the demand for the output. The allocation of common costs that maximizes the firm's overall profit under these conditions is identified. Frequently, the profit maximizing allocation allocates none of the untraceable common costs to one or more of the outputs. This allocation scheme stands in contrast to common practices of sharing costs equally or proportionally across outputs. Examples explore the implications of such a profit maximizing cost allocation on prices and demand in four scenarios: i) no constraints, ii) constraints on maximum allowable prices, iii) a change in market size, and iv) cost containment incentives.

J	BOWDEN, RJ				BOWDEN, RJ			PRODUCTION ORGANIZATION AND RISK CONTROL WHEN MARKET INSTRUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						EXPOSURES; FORWARD; FUTURES; HEDGING; JOINT PRODUCTS; PRICE RISK; PRODUCTION RISK; RISK; SWAPS; UNCERTAINTY	PRICE UNCERTAINTY; FUTURES MARKETS; COMPETITIVE FIRM; DEMAND	A standard result in the theory of production under price risk is that if forward cover is available, production is determined in terms of the known, quoted forward or futures price, rather than expectations of future prices. In practice, however, primary production often involves joint or substitutable products, so that a natural hedge may be available. In addition, costs such as input prices or interest rates are highly variable and may be correlated with output prices. Supply risk adds to this variation. This paper considers the demand for market-based hedging instruments in relation to such natural hedges and to the possible use of storage for hedging purposes. Under normality of conditional price/cost variation it is shown that for relatively arbitrary nonlinear production technologies and attitudes to risk, producers can plan production and derive their demand for futures by decomposing the organisation into a number of activity centres, involving planning, marketing, cost, and treasury functions. Adding up the hedging demands from each centre, and equating to the effective supply of each type of hedge (natural and market), yields a linear system that may be solved for the optimum quantities of each hedge contract.

J	CHOWDHRY, B				CHOWDHRY, B			CORPORATE HEDGING OF EXCHANGE RISK WHEN FOREIGN-CURRENCY CASH FLOW IS UNCERTAIN	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						HEDGING; EXCHANGE RISK; CORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT; INFLATION UNCERTAINTY	POLICIES; RATES; FIRMS	We analyze hedging policies for a corporation that generates a foreign currency cash flow that is not known with certainty. We obtain an intriguing result that the probability of bankruptcy for a firm that attempts to minimize this probability is lower when there is some uncertainty in the exchange rates than when there is no uncertainty in the exchange rates: the firm reduces the probability of bankruptcy by borrowing more than its financing needs through foreign currency borrowing alone and by investing the excess funds in domestic risk-free securities.

J	PEREZ, J				PEREZ, J			SOME COMMENTS ON SAATYS AHP	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; MULTIATTRIBUTE UTILITY THEORY; RANK REVERSAL; MULTIDISTRICT PROPORTIONAL ELECTIONS; DECISION ANALYSIS	ASSESSING ATTRIBUTE WEIGHTS; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; RATIOS	The purpose of this short paper is to help clarify some questions which have arisen with respect to the suitability, or even the correctness, of the way Saaty's AHP method handles criteria weights, sometimes causing the rank reversal phenomenon. The position set forth in this paper is that this undesirable effect does not, per se, invalidate that method, but it does make it necessary to identify the kind of situations in which the method is suitable.
