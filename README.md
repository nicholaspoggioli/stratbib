This repository contains bibliometric data from five journals relevant to strategic management research.

The journals are Strategic Management Journal (SMJ), Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ), Management Science (MGMT SCIENCE), Academy of Maangement Journal (AMJ), and Organization Science (ORG SCI).

Files were downloaded January 17, 2019, from Web of Science and contain the citation, abstract, keywords, and full list of references for every article published in the journal from the date Web of Science begins indexing the journal until the data returned by Web of Science as of January 17, 2019.

Web of Science limits downloads to 500 citations per download, so each data file contains 500 citations, except for the final download which contains between 1 - 500 citations.
